\maketitle

Computing the Gr\"obner basis of an ideal with respect to a giving
term ordering is an essential step in solving systems of polynomials.
Certain term orderings, such as the degree reverse lexicographical
ordering (\textit{degrevlex}), tend to make the computation of the
Gr\"obner basis faster: this has been observed empirically since the
1980's, and is now supported by theoretical results, at least for some
``nice'' families of inputs, such as complete intersections or certain
determinantal systems~\cite{Faugere02,FaSaSp13,BaFaSa15}.  On the
other hand, other orderings, such as the lexicographical ordering
(\textit{lex}), make it easier to find the coordinates of the
solutions, or to perform arithmetic operations in the corresponding
residue class ring.  For instance, for a zero-dimensional radical
ideal $I$ in generic coordinates in $\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$, for some field $\K$,
the lexicographic Gr\"obner basis of $I$ for the lexicographic order $X_1 > \cdots > X_n$
has the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:shapelemma}
 \{ X_1 - R_1(X_n),\dots, X_{n-1}-R_{n-1}(X_n),R_n(X_n)\},
\end{equation}
where $R_n \in \K[X_n]$ is squarefree and all $R_i$'s are in $\K[X_n]$
of degree less than $\deg(R_n)$; this is known as the {\em shape
  lemma}~\cite{GiMo89}. The points in the variety $V(I)$ are then
$$\{ ( R_1(\alpha), \dots, R_{n-1}(\alpha), \alpha ) \mid \forall
 \alpha: R_n(\alpha)=0\}.$$ As a result, the standard approach to
 solve a zero-dimensional system by means of Gr\"obner basis
 algorithms first computes a Gr\"obner basis for a degree ordering,
 then converts it to a more readable output, such as a lexicographic
 basis. As pointed out in~\cite{FaMo17}, the latter step, while of
 polynomial complexity, can now be a bottleneck in practice. This
 paper will thus focus on this stage; in order to describe our 
 contributions, we first discuss previous work on the question.

 Let $I$ be a zero-dimensional ideal in $\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$.  As
 input, we assume that we know a monomial basis $\basis$ of
 $Q=\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I$, together with the multiplication matrices
 $\mM_1,\dots,\mM_n$ of respectively $X_1,\dots,X_n$ in this basis; we
 denote by $D$ the degree of $I$, that is, the vector space dimension
 of $Q$. We should point out that knowing a degree Gr\"obner basis of
 $I$, computing the multiplication matrices efficiently is not a
 straightforward task: Faug\`ere {\it et al.} showed how to do it in
 time $O(nD^3)$ in~\cite{FaGiLaMo93} and more recently, algorithms have
 been given with cost bound
 $\softO{nD^\omega}$~\cite{FaGaHuRe13,FaGaHuRe14,Neiger16}, at
 least for some favorable families of inputs. Here, the notation
 $O\tilde{~}$ hides polylogarithmic factors and $\omega$ is a feasible
 exponent for matrix multiplication. While improving these results in
 an interesting question in itself, we will not address it in this
 paper.

Given such an input, the FGLM algorithm~\cite{FaGiLaMo93} computes the
lexicographic Gr\"obner basis of $I$ in $O(nD^3)$ operations in $\K$.
While the algorithm has an obvious relation to linear algebra,
lowering the runtime to $O\tilde{~}(nD^\omega)$ was only recently
achieved~\cite{FaGaHuRe13,FaGaHuRe14,Neiger16}. 

Polynomials as in~\eqref{eq:shapelemma} are a very useful data
structure, but there is no guarantee that the lexicographic Gr\"obner
basis of $I$ possesses such a structure; when it does, we will say
that $I$ is in {\em shape position} (some sufficient conditions are
in~\cite{BeMoMaTr94}). As an alternative, one may use Rouillier's
Rational Univariate Representation algorithm \cite{Rouillier99} (see
also~\cite{AlBeRoWo94,BeWo96} for related considerations). The output
is a description of the zero-set $V(I)$ by means of rational functions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RUR}
 \{  F(T)=0, \quad X_1 = \frac{G_1(T)}{G(T)}, \dots,X_n = \frac{G_n(T)}{G(T)} \},
\end{equation}
where the multiplicities of a root $\tau$ of $F$ equals that of
$I$ at the corresponding point
$(G_1(\tau)/G(\tau),\dots,G_n(\tau)/G(\tau)) \in V(I)$; the fact that
we use rational functions makes it in particular possible to control
precisely the bit-size of their coefficients, if we work over $\K=\Q$.

The algorithms of~\cite{AlBeRoWo94, BeWo96, Rouillier99} rely on an
idea that will be at the core of our algorithms as well: duality.
Indeed, these algorithms compute sequences of values of the form
$\tau_i=(\trace(X^i))_{i \ge 0}$ or 
$\tau_{i,j}=(\trace(X^i X_j))_{i \ge 0}$, where $\trace: Q \to \K$ is the trace 
form and $X$ is typically of the form $X=t_1 X_1 + \cdots + t_n X_n$.
From these values, it is then possible to recover the output
in~\eqref{eq:RUR} by means of some structured linear algebra calculation.

A drawback of this approach is that we need to know the trace of all
elements of the basis $\basis$; while feasible in polynomial time,
this is by no means straightforward. In~\cite{BoSaSc03}, Bostan {\it
  et al.} introduced randomization to alleviate this issue. They show
that computing values such as $\ell(X^i)$ and $\ell(X^i X_j)$, where
$X$ is as above and 
$\ell$ is a random $\K$-linear form $Q \to \K$, allows one to deduce
a description of $V(I)$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BoSaSc03}
 \{  P(T)=0, \quad X_1 = V_1(T), \dots,X_n = V_n(T) \},
\end{equation}
where $P$ is a monic squarefree polynomial in $\K[T]$ and $V_i$ is in
$\K[T]$ of degree less than $\deg(P)$ for all $i$. Precisely, the
output of such algorithms is the tuple $((P,V_1,\dots,V_n),X)$; this
will be called a {\em zero-dimensional parametrization} of $V(I)$. In
particular, this output will in general differ from the description
in~\eqref{eq:RUR}, since the latter keeps trace of the multiplicities
of the solutions (the algorithm in~\cite{BoSaSc03} actually computes
the {\em nil-indices} of the solutions).

The most costly part of such an algorithm is the computation of the
values $\ell(X^i)$ and $\ell(X^i X_j)$; the rest essentially boils
down to applying the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm and univariate
polynomial arithmetic. In~\cite{FaMo17}, Faug{\`e}re and Mou pointed
out that the multiplication matrices $\mM_1,\dots,\mM_n$ can be
expected to be sparse; they give precise estimates on their expected
sparsity, assuming the validity of a conjecture due to
Moreno-Soc\'ias~\cite{MorenoSocias91}. 
On this basis, they designed several forms of {\em sparse FGLM}
algorithms. For instance, if $I$ is in shape position, the algorithms
in \cite{FaMo17} recover this basis, also by considering values of
a linear form $\ell:Q \to \K$. For less favorable inputs, the algorithm
falls back on the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm~\cite{Sakata90},
or plain FGLM.

The ideas at play in these algorithms are essentially Krylov space
methods, using projections and Berlekamp-Massey techniques; they are
also widely used in integer factorization or discrete logarithm
calculations~\cite{xxx,yyy}. It is then natural to adapt to our
context the block version of such algorithms, as pioneered by
Coppersmith~\cite{Coppersmith94} in the context of integer
factorization; this makes it possible to easily parallelize the
bottleneck of the algorithm. This was already discussed by Steel
in~\cite{Steel15}, where he showed how to compute the analogue of
polynomial $P$ in~\eqref{eq:BoSaSc03}. In that reference, one is
only interested in the solutions in the base field $\K$ ($\K$ being a
finite field in that context): the algorithm computes the roots of $P$
in $\K$ and substitutes them in the input system, before computing a
Gr\"obner basis in $n-1$ variables for each of them.

Our first contribution is to give a block version of
the algorithm in~\cite{BoSaSc03} that extends the approach
in~\cite{Steel15} to compute all polynomials in~\eqref{eq:BoSaSc03}
for essentially the same cost as the computation of $P$.


\paragraph{Complexity model.}
We measure the cost of our algorithms by counting all operations in
$\K$ at unit cost. Most algorithms are randomized; they involve the
choice of a vector $\gamma \in \K^S$ of field elements, for some $S$
that depends on the size of our input, and success is guaranteed if
the vector $\gamma$ avoid a hypersurface of the parameter space
$\K^S$. Given a zero-dimensional parametrization computed by one of
these algorithms, one can always evaluate 

We rely 
Over a field $\mathbb{K}$, recall that we can compute multiplication,
division with remainder, extended GCD, and square free part of
polynomial of degree at most $n$ in $O^{\tilde{~}}(n)$ field
operations ($O^{\tilde{~}}$ omits polylogarithmic factors)
\cite{GaGe13}.

\section{Basic results on linearly recurrent sequences}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Scalar sequences} \label{section:linseq}

Let $\K$ be a field and consider a sequence $\mathcal{L}=(\ell_s)_{s
  \ge 0} \in \K^\N$ and the associated generating series
$\genseries=\sum_{s \ge 0} \ell_s T^s \in \K[[T]]$. We say that a
degree $d$ polynomial $P\in\K[T]$ {\em cancels} a sequence
$(\ell_s)_{s \ge 0}$ if $p_0 \ell_s + \cdots + p_d \ell_{s+d}=0$ for
all $s \ge 0$, where $p_0,\dots,p_d$ are the coefficients of $P$; this
is equivalent to ${\rm rev}(P) \genseries$ being a polynomial of
degree less than $d$, with $\genseries=\sum_{s \ge 0} \ell_s T^s$ and
${\rm rev}(P)=T^d P(1/T)$.

The sequence $(\ell_s)_{s \ge 0}$ is {\em linearly recurrent} if there
exists a non-zero polynomial that cancels it; this is the case if and
only if there exist polynomials $A,B$ in $\K[T]$ such that
$\genseries=A/B$; these polynomials are unique if we assume
$\gcd(A,B)=1$ and $B(0)=1$.  The {\em minimal polynomial} of a linearly
recurrent sequence $\mathcal{L}=(\ell_s)_{s \ge 0}$ is the monic polynomial of
lowest degree that cancels it. Given the closed form $\genseries =
A/B$ as defined above, its minimal polynomial is $P =
T^{\max(\deg(A)+1,\deg(B))}B(1/T)$. The {\em order} of $\mathcal{L}$ is the
degree of this polynomial $P$.

It is often easier to work with a closed form that has the actual
minimal polynomial as its denominator, rather than its reverse; this
is done by working with generating series in the variable $1/T$.
Let indeed $\genseries^* = \sum_{s\ge0} \ell_s / T^{s+1}$ and $P$ be
any polynomial; then, $P$ cancels the sequence
$(\ell_s)_{s\ge0}$ if and only if $Q=P \genseries^* $ is a polynomial
of degree less than $\deg(P)$, so that $\genseries^*=Q/P$, with $\deg(Q)<
\deg(P)$.  Using generating series in $1/T$, the minimal polynomial of
$(\ell_s)_{s \ge 0}$ is thus the monic polynomial $P$ of minimal degree for
which there exists $Q \in \K[T]$ that satisfies $\genseries^*=Q/P$.

In particular, given a sequence $(\ell_s)_{s \ge 0}$ and a polynomial
that cancels it, there is a well-defined notion of associated
numerator.  The next definition makes this idea precise:
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:omega}
  Let $\mathcal{L}=(\ell_s)_{s \ge 0}$ be a sequence and let $P$ be a
  polynomial that cancels $\mathcal{L}$. Then, the {\em numerator} of $\mathcal{L}$
  with respect to $P$ is defined as 
  $$\Omega(\mathcal{L},P) = P \sum_{s \ge 0} \frac {\ell_s}{T^{s+1}}.$$ In
  view of the discussion above, we deduce that $\Omega(S,P)$ is a
  polynomial of degree less than $\deg(P)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}~
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We may as well write this definition using expressions in
    variable $T$ instead of $1/T$: given
    $\mathcal{L}=(\ell_s)_{s\ge0}$ and $P$ as above, we recover
    $\Omega(\ell,P)$ by considering $\genseries=\sum_{s\ge 0} \ell_s
    T^s$ and computing $A = {\rm rev}(P) L$, with ${\rm rev}(P)=T^d
    P(1/T)$, with $d=\deg(P)$; then
    $$\Omega(\mathcal{L} ,P) = T^{d - 1} A (1/T).$$ 
\item If $\deg(P)=d$, we only need to know the coefficients
  $\ell_0,\dots,\ell_{d-1}$ to compute $\Omega(\mathcal{L}, P)$. Explicitly, we 
  have
  $$\Omega(\mathcal{L},P) = ( P \sum_{s=0}^{d} \ell_{d - s} T^s ) {\rm ~div~} T^d.$$
 \end{itemize}
\end{remark}
We give an example of this using the Fibonacci sequence $F =
(1,1,2,3,5,8,\dots)$, which is linearly recurrent, with minimal
polynomial $P=T^2-T-1$. Define $\genseries= \sum_{s\ge 0} F_{s} T^s$ and
${\rm rev}(P) = 1-T-T^2$; then, we can write $\genseries$ in closed form as:
$$\genseries = \frac{A}{{\rm rev}(P)} = \frac{1}{1-T-T^2},$$
so that $\Omega(F,P)=T^{2-1} \cdot 1=T$. Equivalently, we can define $\genseries^* = \sum_{s\ge0} F_{s}/T^{s+1}$; then, 
we recover 
\begin{align*}
\Omega(F,P) &= (T^2-T-1)\left (\frac 1T +\frac 1{T^2} + \frac 2{T^3} + \frac 3{T^4} + \cdots \right ) \\
&=T.
\end{align*}
In terms of complexity, assuming that $\mathcal{L}$ has order at most $D$,
given the first $2D$ terms of $\mathcal{L}$, we can recover its minimal
polynomial $P$ by means of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, or of Euclid's
algorithm applied to rational function reconstruction; this can be done
in $O(\M(D)\log(D))$ operations in $\K$. Once we know $P$, we can
deduce $\Omega(\mathcal{L},P)$ for the cost $\M(D)$ of one polynomial multiplication.

\subsection{Linearly recurrent matrix sequences}\label{section:matrix_seq}

Next, we discuss the analogue of these ideas for matrix sequences; our
main goal is to give a cost estimate for the computation of a suitable
{\em matrix generator} for a matrix sequence $\seq$, obtained by means
of recent algorithms for approximants bases. A similar discussion
(without a cost analysis) is in~\cite[Chapter~4]{Turner02}.

We first present the notion of linear recurrence for sequences of
matrices over a field $\field$, which extends the well-known notion
for sequences in $\field^\NN$; the definition comes
from~\cite[Section~3]{KalVil01} and~\cite[Definition~4.2]{Turner02}.
\begin{definition}
  
  \label{dfn:recurrence_relation}
  Let $\seq = (\seqelt{s})_{s\ge 0} \subset \seqeltSpace$ be a matrix
  sequence.  Then,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a polynomial $P = p_0 + \cdots + p_\degBd T^\degBd \in \polRing$ is
    a \emph{scalar relation for $\seq$} if $
    p_0 \seqelt{s} + \cdots + p_{\degBd} \seqelt{s+\degBd} = 0$ holds for all $s \ge 0$;
  \item a polynomial vector 
$\rel = p_0 + \cdots + p_\degBd T^\degBd \in
    \relSpace$ is  a \emph{(left, vector) relation for $\seq$} if
$   p_0 \seqelt{s} + \cdots + p_{\degBd} \seqelt{s+\degBd} = 0$ holds for all
    $s \ge 0$;
  \item $\seq$ is  \emph{linearly recurrent} if there exists a
    non-zero scalar relation for $\seq$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
For designing efficient algorithms, it will be useful to rely on operations on
polynomials or truncated series; hence the following characterization of vector
relations.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:linearly_recurrent}
  Consider a matrix sequence $\seq = (\seqelt{s})_{s\ge 0} \subset
  \seqeltSpace$ and its generating series $\seqpm = \sum_{s\ge 0} \seqelt{s} /
  \var^{s+1} \in \field\Poxi^{\rdim \times \cdim}$.  Then, $\rel \in \relSpace$
  is a vector relation for $\seq$ if and only if the entries of $\num = \rel
  \seqpm$ are in $\polRing$; furthermore, in this case, $\deg(\num) <
  \deg(\rel)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\rel = \sum_{0 \le k \le \degBd} p_k \var^k$. For $s \ge 0$,
  the coefficient of $\num$ of degree $-s-1<0$ is $\sum_{0\le k \le
    \degBd} p_k \seqelt{s+k}$. Hence the equivalence, by definition of
  a relation.  The degree comparison is clear since $\seqpm$ has only
  terms of negative degree.
\end{proof}

Concerning the algebraic structure of the set of vector relations, we have the
following basic result, which can be found for example in
\cite{Villard97,KalVil01,Turner02}.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:module_rank}
  The sequence $\seq$ is linearly recurrent if and only if the set of left
  vector relations for $\seq$ is a $\polRing$-submodule of $\relSpace$ of rank
  $\rdim$.
\end{lemma}
%% \begin{proof}
%% 	The set of vector relations for $\seq$ is a $\polRing$-submodule of
%% 	$\relSpace$, and hence is free of rank at most $\rdim$

%% \end{proof}

Note however that a matrix sequence may admit nontrivial vector relations and
have no scalar relation (and therefore not be linearly recurrent with the
present definition); in this case the module of vector relations has rank less
than $\rdim$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{dfn:matrix_generator}
  Let $\seq \subset \seqeltSpace$ be linearly recurrent.  A \emph{(left) matrix
    generator} $\mat{P}$ for $\seq$ is a matrix in $\relbasSpace$ whose rows form a basis
  of the module of left vector relations for $\seq$. This basis is said to be
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{minimal} if the matrix is row reduced \cite{Wolovich74,Kailath80};
  \item \emph{canonical} if the matrix is in Popov form \cite{Popov72,Kailath80}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Note that the canonical generator is also a minimal generator;
furthermore, all matrix generators $\relbas \in \relbasSpace$ for
$\seq$ have the same determinantal degree $\deg(\det(\relbas))$, which
we denote by $\degDet$.  


We now show that minimal matrix generators are denominators in some
irreducible fraction description of the generating series of the
sequence.  This is a direct consequence of
\cref{lem:linearly_recurrent,lem:module_rank} and of basic properties
of polynomial matrices.

In what follows, for an $r \times s$ matrix $\mat{P}$ with entries in
$\K[T]$, we denote by $\rdeg{\mat{P}}$ and $\cdeg{\mat{P}}$
respectively its row-degree and column-degrees, that is, the size-$r$
vector of the degrees of its rows, respectively the size-$s$ vector of
the degrees of its columns.

\begin{corollary}
  A matrix sequence $\seq = (\seqelt{s})_{s\ge 0}
  \subset \seqeltSpace$ is linearly recurrent if and only if its
  generating series $\seqpm = \sum_{s\ge 0} \seqelt{s} / \var^{s+1}
  \in \field\Poxi^{\rdim \times \cdim}$ can be written as a matrix
  fraction $\seqpm = \relbas^{-1} \nummat$ where $\relbas
  \in \relbasSpace$ is nonsingular and $\nummat \in
  \polMatSpace[\rdim][\cdim]$. In this case, we have $\rdeg{\nummat} <
  \rdeg{\relbas}$ and $\deg(\det(\relbas)) \ge \degDet$, and $\relbas$
  is a matrix generator of $\seq$ if and only if $\deg(\det(\relbas))
  = \degDet$ or, equivalently, the fraction $\relbas^{-1} \nummat$ is
  irreducible (that is, $\mat{U} \relbas + \mat{V} \nummat = \mat{I}$
  for some polynomial matrices $\mat{U}$ and $\mat{V}$).
\end{corollary}

We remark that we may also consider vector relations operating on the
right: in particular, \cref{lem:linearly_recurrent} shows that if the
sequence is linearly recurrent then these right relations form a
submodule of $\polMatSpace[\cdim][1]$ of rank $\cdim$. Thus, a
linearly recurrent sequence also admits a right canonical generator.

Now, we focus on our algorithmic problem: given a linearly recurrent
sequence, find a minimal matrix generator.  We assume the availability
of bounds $(\degBdl,\degBdr)$ on the degrees of the left and right
canonical generators, which allow us to control the number of terms of
the sequence we will access during the algorithm.  Since taking the
Popov form of a reduced matrix does not change the degree, any 
minimal left matrix generator $\relbas$ has the same degree $\deg(\relbas)$
as the left canonical generator: thus, $\degBdl$ is also a bound on
the degree of any minimal left generator. The same remark holds for
$\degBdr$ and right minimal generators.  The bounds $\degBdl,\degBdr$
are the same as $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ in
\cite[Definitions~4.6~and~4.7]{Turner02}; see also $\delta_l,\delta_r$
in \cite[Section~4.2]{Villard97a}; a result similar to the following
lemma is in \cite[Theorem~4.5]{Turner02}.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:finitely_many_terms}
  Let $\seq = (\seqelt{s})_{s \ge 0} \subset \seqeltSpace$ be linearly
  recurrent and let $\degBdr \in \NN$ be such that the right canonical
  matrix generator of $\seq$ has degree at most $\degBdr$.  Then,
  $\rel =p_0 + \cdots +p_{\degBd}\var^\degBd \in \relSpace$ is a left
  relation for $\seq$ if and only if $p_0 \seqelt{s} + \cdots +
  p_{\degBd} \seqelt{s + \degBd} = 0$ holds for $s \in
  \{0,\ldots,\degBdr-1\}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Since the right canonical generator $\relbas
  \in \polMatSpace[\cdim]$ is in column Popov form, we have $\relbas =
  \mat{L}\,\diag{\var^{t_1},\ldots,\var^{t_{\cdim}}} - \mat{Q}$ where
  $\cdeg{\mat{Q}} < \cdeg{\relbas} = (t_1,\ldots,t_{\cdim})$
  componentwise and $\mat{L} \in \matSpace[\cdim]$ is unit upper
  triangular. We define the matrix $\mat{U} =
  \diag{\var^{\degBdr-t_1},\ldots,\var^{\degBdr-t_{\cdim}}}
  \mat{L}^{-1}$, which is in $\polMatSpace[\cdim]$ since $\degBdr \ge
  \deg(\relbas) = \max_j t_j$. Then, the columns of the right multiple
  $\relbas \mat{U} = \var^{\degBdr} \mat{I}_\cdim - \mat{Q} \mat{U}$
  are right relations for $\seq$, and we have $\deg(\mat{Q} \mat{U}) <
  \degBdr$. As a consequence, writing $\mat{Q} \mat{U} = \sum_{0 \le k
    < \degBdr} Q_k \var^k$, we have $\seqelt{s+\degBdr} = \sum_{0
    \le k < \degBdr} \seqelt{s+k} Q_k$ for all $s \ge 0$.
	
  Assuming that 
 $p_0 \seqelt{s} + \cdots +
  p_{\degBd} \seqelt{s + \degBd} = 0$ holds
  for all $s \in \{0,\ldots,\degBdr-1\}$, we prove by induction that this
  holds for all $s\in\NN$. Let $s \ge \degBdr-1$ and assume that this
  identity holds for all integers up to $s$. Then, the identity concluding
  the previous paragraph implies that
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{0 \le k \le \degBd} p_{k} \seqelt{s+1 + k} & =
    \sum_{0 \le k \le \degBd} p_{k} \left(\sum_{0\le j<\degBdr} \seqelt{s+1+k-\degBdr+j} Q_j\right) \\
    & = \sum_{0\le j<\degBdr} 
    \underbrace{\left(\sum_{0 \le k \le \degBd} p_{k} \seqelt{s+1-\degBdr+j+k}\right)}_{=\, 0 \text{ since } s+1-\degBdr+j \le s} Q_j = 0,
  \end{align*}
  and the proof is complete.
\end{proof}


The fast computation of matrix generators is usually handled via algorithms for
computing minimal approximant bases \cite{Villard97,Turner02,GioLeb14}. The
next result gives the main idea behind this approach. This result is similar to
\cite[Theorem~4.6]{Turner02} (see also
\cite[Theorems~4.7,~4.8,~4.9,~4.10]{Turner02}), but in some sense the reversal
is on the input sequence rather than on the output matrix generator.

We recall from \cite{BarBul92,BecLab94} that, given a matrix $\sys \in
\polMatSpace[\rdim][\cdim]$ and an integer $d \in \NN$, the set of
\emph{approximants for $\sys$ at order $d$} is defined as
\[
\appMod{\sys}{d} = \{ \rel \in \relSpace \mid \rel \sys = 0 \bmod \var^d \}.
\]

Then, the next theorem shows that relations for $\seq$ can be retrieved as
subvectors of approximants at order about $\degBdl+\degBdr$ for a matrix
involving the first $\degBdl+\degBdr$ entries of $\seq$. 

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:mingen_via_appbas}
  Let $\seq = (\seqelt{s})_{s \ge 0} \subset \seqeltSpace$ be a linearly recurrent
  sequence and let $(\degBdl,\degBdr) \in \NN^2$ be such that the left
  (resp.~right) canonical matrix generator of $\seq$ has degree
  $\le\degBdl$ (resp.~$\le \degBdr$).
    For $\degBd>0$, define
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:series_to_approximate}
    \sys =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \sum_{0\le s < \degBd} \seqelt{s} \var^{\degBd-s-1} \\ - \mat{I}_{\cdim}
    \end{bmatrix} \in \polMatSpace[(\rdim+\cdim)][\cdim].
  \end{equation}
  Suppose that  $\degBd \ge \degBdr+1$ and let $\mat{B} \in \polMatSpace[(\rdim+\cdim)][(\rdim+\cdim)]$
  be a basis of $\appMod{\sys}{\degBdl+\degBdr+1}$. Then,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item if $\mat{B}$ is in Popov form then its $\rdim\times\rdim$ leading
    principal submatrix is the canonical matrix generator for $\seq$;
  \item if $\mat{B}$ is row reduced then it has exactly $\rdim$ rows of
    degree $\le\degBdl$, and the corresponding submatrix $[\relbas \;\;
      \remmat]$ of $\mat{B}$ is such that $\relbas\in\relSpace$ is a minimal
    matrix generator for~$\seq$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  For any relation $\rel \in \relSpace$ for $\seq$, there exists $\rem \in
  \remSpace$ such that $\deg(\rem) < \deg(\rel)$ and $[\rel \;\; \rem]
  \in \appMod{\sys}{\degBd}$. Indeed, from
  \cref{lem:linearly_recurrent}, if $\rel$ is a relation for $\seq$
  then $\num = \rel \seqpm$ has polynomial entries, where $\seqpm =
  \sum_{s\ge 0} \seqelt{s} \var^{-s-1}$. Then, the vector $\rem = -
  \rel (\sum_{s \ge \degBd} \seqelt{s} \var^{\degBd-s-1})$ has
  polynomial entries, has degree less than $\deg(\rel)$, and is such
  that $[\rel \;\; \rem] \sys = \num \var^{\degBd}$, hence $[\rel \;\;
    \rem] \in \appMod{\sys}{\degBd}$.

  Conversely, for any vectors $\rel \in \relSpace$ and $\rem
  \in \remSpace$, if $[\rel \;\; \rem] \in\appMod{\sys}{\degBd}$ and
  $\deg([\rel \;\; \rem])\le\degBd-\degBdr-1$, then $\rel$ is a
  relation for $\seq$. Indeed, if $[\rel \;\; \rem]
  \in\appMod{\sys}{\degBd}$ we have $\rel (\sum_{0\le s< \degBd}
  \seqelt{s} \var^{\degBd-s-1}) = \rem \bmod \var^\degBd$. Since
  $\degBd\ge\degBdr+1$ and $\deg([\rel \;\;
    \rem])\le\degBd-\degBdr-1$, this implies that the coefficients of
  degree $\degBd-\degBdr$ to $\degBd-1$ of $\rel(\sum_{0\le s <
    \degBd} \seqelt{s} \var^{\degBd-s-1})$ are zero. Then,
  \cref{lem:finitely_many_terms} shows that $\rel$ is a relation for
  $\seq$.
  
  The two items in the theorem are straightforward consequences.
\end{proof}

Using fast approximant basis algorithms, we obtain the main results
from this section. They are stated in slightly more generality than
needed, since in our main algorithm, we will always use $\cdim =
\rdim$.  However, we believe that the more general form stated here
may find further applications. The proof is a direct consequence of
the previous theorem, using the algorithms of
respectively~\cite{GiJeVi03},~\cite{ZhoLab12} and~\cite{JeNeScVi16}.
\todo{choose $d \ge \dots$}
\begin{corollary}\label{coro:cost_approx}
  Let $\seq \subset \seqeltSpace$ be a linearly recurrent sequence and
  let $\degBd = \degBdl+\degBdr+1$, where $(\degBdl,\degBdr) \in
  \NN^2$ are such that the left (resp.~right) canonical matrix
  generator of $\seq$ has degree $\le\degBdl$ (resp.~$\le \degBdr$).
  Then, given $\seqelt{0},\dots,\seqelt{d-1}$,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item if $\cdim \in \Omega(\rdim)$, a  minimal left matrix generator
    for $\seq$ can be computed in $O(\cdim^\omega \M(\degBd)
    \log(\degBd))$ operations in $\field$;
  \item if $\cdim \in O(\rdim)$, a  minimal left matrix generator for
    $\seq$ can be computed in $O(\rdim^\omega \M(\cdim\degBd/\rdim)
    \log(\cdim\degBd))$ operations in $\field$;
  \item the left canonical matrix generator for $\seq$ can be computed
    in $O((\rdim+\cdim)^{\omega-1} \M(\cdim\degBd)
    \log(\cdim\degBd)^3)$ operations in $\field$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{corollary}
In particular, when $\cdim = \rdim$, we can find the left canonical
matrix generator of $\seq$ in $O(\rdim^\omega \M(\degBd)
\log(\degBd))$ operations in $\field$.

\subsection{The block Wiedemann algorithm}

Finally, we apply the results seen above to a particular class of
matrix sequences, namely the Krylov sequences used in the block
Wiedemann algorithm. The claim below is not new; it can be found
in~\cite{Villard97a} and~\cite{KaVi04}; we chose to give a
close-to-self-contained presentation, that refers to the above
references for the key properties.

Let $\mM$ be in $\mathbb{K}^{D \times D}$ and $\mU,\mV \in
\mathbb{K}^{D \times m}$ be two blocking matrices; we can then
define the Krylov sequence $\seq^{\mU,\mV}=(\seqelt{s}^{\mU,\mV})_{s \ge 0}$ 
by
$$F^{\mU,\mV}_s = \mU^{\perp} \mM^s \mV, \quad s \ge 0.$$ This
sequence is linearly recurrent, since the minimal polynomial of $\mM$
is a scalar relation for it. The following theorem gives a bound on
the degree of a minimal left generator of $\seq^{\mU,\mV}$,
for generic choices of $\mU$ and $\mV$; we also
state properties of the invariant factors of such a generator.
\todo{check Turner}

To do so, we let $s_1, \dots, s_r$ be the invariant factors of $T\mI_D
- \mM$, ordered in such a way that $s_r | s_{r-1}| \dots | s_1$, and
let $d_i = $ deg$(s_i)$ for all $i$; for $i > r$, we let $s_i$ = 1,
with $d_i = 0$.  We define $\nu = d_1 + \cdots + d_m \le D$ and
$\delta = \lceil \nu / m \rceil \le \lceil D / m \rceil$.

%% \todo{unify subscripts  $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}$ or   $\seq^{\mU,\mV}$}

%% First, we present a proof that one can compute the minimal polynomial
%% of $\mM$ from the output of Matrix Berlekamp-Massey if we choose the
%% blocking matrices $\mU$ and $\mV$ generically.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{randXY}
  For a generic choice of $\mU$ and $\mV$, the following holds.  Let
  $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}$ be a minimal left generator for
  $\seq^{\mU,\mV}$ and denote by $\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_k$ the
  invariant factors of $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}$, for some $k \le m$,
  ordered as above; write $\sigma_i=1$ for $i > k$. Then,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}$ has degree $\delta$;
  \item $s_i = \sigma_i$ for $1 \le i \le m$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Without loss of generality, we can assume that
  $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}$ is a canonical left generator. Then, define
  the matrix sequence $\seq^{\mV} = (\mM^s \mV)_{s \ge 0}$; this
  sequence is linearly generated as well, and we let
  $\mat{P}^{\mV}$ be a canonical left generator for it.

  We denote by $\langle \mV \rangle$ the vector space generated by the
  columns of $\mV,\mM\mV,\mM^2\mV,\dots$, and we write
  $D_\mV=\dim(\langle \mV \rangle)$.
	
  First, we prove that for any $\mV$ in $\K^{D \times m}$, for a
  generic $\mU$ in $\K^{D\times m}$,
  $\mat{P}^{\mV}=\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}$.  Indeed,
  by~\cite[Lemma~4.2]{Villard97a}, there exists matrices $\mat{Q}_\mV$
  in $\K^{D\times D_\mV}$ and $\mM_\mV \in \K^{D_\mV \times D_\mV}$, with
  $\mat{Q}_\mV$ of full rank $D_\mV$, and where $\mM_\mV$ is a matrix of the
  restriction of $\mM$ to $\langle \mV \rangle$, such that
  $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}=\mat{P}^{\mV}$ if and only if the
  dimension of the span of $[\mZ ~ \mB_\mV \mZ ~\mB_\mV^2 \mZ ~ \cdots]$
  is equal to $D_\mV$, with $\mB_\mV=\mM_\mV^\perp$ and $\mZ=\mat{P}_\mV^\perp
  \mU \in \K^{D_\mV \times m}$.
	
  By construction, one can find a basis of $\langle \mV \rangle$ in
  which the matrix of $\mM_\mV$ is block-companion, with $\mu \le m$
  blocks (take the $\mM_\mV$-span of the first column of $\mV$, then of
  the second column, working modulo the previous vector space, etc.)
  Thus, $\mB_\mV$ is similar to a block-companion matrix with $\mu$
  blocks as well; since $\mZ$ has $m$ columns, the span of $[\mZ ~
    \mB_\mV \mZ ~\mB_\mV^2 \mZ ~ \cdots]$ has full dimension $D_\mV$ for a
  generic $\mZ$ (and for a generic $\mU$, since $P_\mV$ has rank
  $D_\mV$). Thus, as claimed, for generic choices of $\mU$ and $\mV$,
  $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}=\mat{P}^{\mV}$.
	
  Let us next introduce a matrix $\scrV$ of indeterminates of size $D
  \times m$, and let $\mat{P}^{\mM,\scrV}$ be the canonical generating
  polynomial of the ``generic'' sequence $(\mM^s \scrV)_{s \ge
    0}$. The notation $\langle \scrV \rangle$ and $D_\scrV$ are
  defined as above.  In particular,
  by~\cite[Proposition~6.1]{Villard97a}, the canonical generating
  polynomial $\mat{P}^{\mM,\scrV}$ has degree $\delta$ and determinantal
  degree $\nu$.
  
%%  Indeed,
%%   $\langle \scrV\rangle$ is the span of $K_\scrV=[\scrV ~ \mM \scrV ~
%%     \cdots ~ \mM^{N-1} \scrV]$, whereas $\langle \mV \rangle$ is the
%%   span of $[\mV ~ \mM \mV ~ \cdots ~\mM^{N-1} \mV]$.
%% Take a
%%  maximal non-zero minor $\mu$ of $K_\scrV$; as soon as $\mu(Y)\ne 0$,
%%  we have equality of the dimensions.
  Now, for a generic $\mV$ in $\K^{D\times m}$, $D_\mV=D_\scrV$. On the
  other hand, by~\cite[Lemma~4.3]{Villard97a}, for any $\mV$
  (including $\scrV$), the degree of $\mat{P}^{\mV}$ is equal to
  the first index $d$ such that the dimension of ${\rm span}([\mV ~ \mM \mV ~
    \cdots ~\mM^{d-1} \mV])$ is $D_\mV$. As a result, for generic $\mV$,
  $\mat{P}^{\mV}$ and $\mat{P}^{\mM,\scrV}$ have the same degree,
  that is, $\delta$.  The first item is proved.
	
  We conclude by proving that for generic $\mU,\mV$, the invariant
  factors $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_m$ of $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}$ are
  $s_1,\dots,s_m$.  By~\cite[Theorem~2.12]{KaVi04}, for any $\mU$ and
  $\mV$ in $\K^{D\times m}$, for $i=1,\dots,m$, the $i$-th invariant
  factor $\sigma_i$ of $\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}$ divides $s_i$, so that
  $\deg(\det(\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}))\le\nu$, with equality if and only
  if $\sigma_i=s_i$ for all $i \le m$.
	
  For $\mV$ as above and any integers $e,d$, we let ${\rm
    Hk}_{e,d}(\mV)$ be the block Hankel matrix
  $$ {\rm Hk}_{e,d}(\mV) =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mI_D \\  \mM \\  \mM^2 \\ \vdots  \\  \mM^{e-1}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mV & \mM\mV & \mM^2\mV &\cdots& \mM^{d-1}\mV
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$ By~\cite[Eq.~(2.6)]{KaVi04}, ${\rm rank}({\rm Hk}_{e,d}(\mV)) =
  \deg(\det(\mat{P}^{\mV}))$ for $d \ge \deg(\mat{P}^{\mV})$
  and $e \ge D$.  We take $e=D$, so that ${\rm rank}({\rm
    Hk}_{D,d}(\mV)) = \deg(\det(\mat{P}^{\mV}))$ for $d \ge
  \deg(\mat{P}^{\mV})$. On the other hand, the sequence ${\rm
    rank}({\rm Hk}_{N,d}(\mV))$ is constant for $d \ge D$; as a
  result, ${\rm rank}({\rm Hk}_{D,D}(\mV)) =
  \deg(\det(\mat{P}^{\mV}))$. For the same reason, we also have ${\rm
    rank}({\rm Hk}_{D,D}(\scrV)) = \deg(\det(\mat{P}^{\mM,\scrV}))$, so that
  for a generic $\mV$, $\mat{P}^{\mV}$ and $\mat{P}^{\mM,\scrV}$
  have the same determinantal degree, that is, $\nu$.  As a result,
  for generic $\mU$ and $\mV$, we also have
  $\deg(\det(\mat{P}^{\mU,\mV}))=\nu$, and the conclusion follows.
\end{proof} 

In particular, combining \cref{coro:cost_approx} and \cref{randXY}, we
deduce that for generic $\mU,\mV$, given the first $2 \lceil D/m
\rceil$ terms of the sequence $\seq^{\mU,\mV}$, we can recover a
minimal matrix generator of it using $O(m^\omega \M(D/m) \log(D/m))
\subset \softO{m^{\omega-1} D}$ operations in $\K$.

\section{Structure of the dual}

{\bf this is a mess}

For $i$ in $\{1,\dots,d\}$, let $Q_i$ be the local algebra at
$\balpha_i$, that is $Q_i=\Kbar[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I_i$, with $I_i$ the
$\m_{\balpha_i}$-primary component of $I$. By the Chinese Remainder
Theorem, $Q\otimes_\K \Kbar=\Kbar[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I$ is isomorphic to
the direct product $Q_1\times \cdots \times Q_d$.  We let $N_i$ be the
{\em nil-index} of $Q_i$, that is, the maximal integer $N$ such that
$\m_{\alpha_i}^N$ is not contained in $I_i$; for instance, $N_i=0$ if
and only if $Q_i$ is a field, if and only if $\balpha_i$ is a
non-singular root of $I$. We also let
$\D_i=\dim_\Kbar(Q_i)$, so that we have $D_i \ge N_i$ and $\D=\D_1 + \cdots + \D_d$.


The sequences we consider below are of the form $(\ell(t^s))_{s \ge
	0}$, for $\ell$ a $\K$-linear form $Q \to \K$ and $t$ in $Q$. For such
sequences, the following standard result will be useful.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:minpoly}
	Let $t$ be in $Q$ and let $P \in \K[T]$ be its minimal
	polynomial. For a generic choice of $\ell$ in ${\rm hom}_\K(Q,\K)$,
	$P$ is the minimal polynomial of the sequence $(\ell(t^s))_{s \ge
		0}$.
\end{lemma}


Fix $i$ in $1,\dots,d$.  There exists a basis of the dual ${\rm
	hom}_\Kbar(Q_i,\Kbar)$ consisting of linear forms
$(\lambda_{i,j})_{1\le j \le \D_i}$ of the form
$$\lambda_{i,j}: f \mapsto (\Lambda_{i,j}(f))(\balpha_i),$$
where $\Lambda_{i,j}$ is the operator
$$f \mapsto \Lambda_{i,j}(f) = \sum_{\mu=(\mu_1,\dots,\mu_n) \in
	S_{i,j}} c_{i,j,\mu} \frac{ \partial^{\mu_1 + \cdots + \mu_n} f}
{\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots \partial X_n^{\mu_n}},$$ for some finite
subset $S_{i,j}$ of $\N^n$ and non-zero constants $c_{i,j,\mu}$ in
$\Kbar$. 
%% Let $w_{i,j}$ be the maximum of all $|\mu|$ for $\mu$ in
%% $S_{i,j}$, with $|\mu| = \mu_1 +\cdots + \mu_n $.
%% By~\cite[Lemma~3.3]{Mourrain97}, we have that $\max_j w_{i,j} =N_i$
%% for all $i$.
For instance, when $\balpha_i$ is non-singular, we have $D_i=1$, so
there is only one function $\lambda_{i,j}$, namely $\lambda_{i,1}$, we
write it $\lambda_{i,1}(f) = f(\balpha_i)$.

More generally, we can always take $\lambda_{i,1}$ of the form
$\lambda_{i,1}(f) = f(\balpha_i)$; for $j>1$, we can then also assume
that $S_{i,j}$ does not contain $\mu=(0,\dots,0)$ (that is, all terms
in $\Lambda_{i,j}$ have order $1$ or more). Thus, introducing new
variables $(U_{i,j})_{j =1,\dots,D_i}$, we deduce the existence of
non-zero homogeneous linear forms $P_{i,\mu}$ in
$(U_{i,j})_{j=1,\dots,D_i}$ such that for any $\lambda$ in ${\rm
	hom}_\Kbar(Q_i,\Kbar)$, there exist $\bu_i=(u_{i,j}) \in
\Kbar{}^{D_i}$ such that we have
\begin{align}\label{ell_param}
\lambda: f \mapsto \lambda(f)
&= \sum_{j=1}^{D_i} u_{i,j} \lambda_{i,j}(f)\nonumber\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{D_i} u_{i,j} \big(\Lambda_{i,j}(f)\big)(\balpha_i)\nonumber\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{D_i} u_{i,j}
\sum_{\mu=(\mu_1,\dots,\mu_n) \in
	S_{i,j}} c_{i,j,\mu} \frac{ \partial^{\mu_1 + \cdots + \mu_n} f}
{\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots \partial X_n^{\mu_n}}(\balpha_i)\nonumber\\
&= \sum_{\mu=(\mu_1,\dots,\mu_n) \in S_i} P_{i,\mu}(\bu_i)
\frac{ \partial^{\mu_1 + \cdots + \mu_n} f}
{\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots \partial X_n^{\mu_n}}(\balpha_i),
\end{align}
where $S_i$ is  the union of $S_{i,1},\dots,S_{i,D_i}$,
with in particular $P_{i,(0,\dots,0)}=u_{i,1}$ and where $P_{i,\mu}$
depends only on $(u_{i,j})_{j =2,\dots,D_i}$ for all $\mu$ in $S_i$,
$\mu \ne (0,\dots,0)$. Explicily, we can write $P_{i,\mu}=\sum_{j\in
	\{1,\dots,D_i\} \text{~such that~} \mu \in S_{i,j}} c_{i,j,\mu}
U_{i,j}$.

Fix $\lambda$ non-zero in ${\rm hom}_\Kbar(Q_i,\Kbar)$. We can then
define its {\em order} $w$ and {\em symbol} $\pi$. The former is
the maximum of all $|\mu|=\mu_1+\cdots+\mu_n$ for
$\mu=(\mu_1,\dots,\mu_n)$ in $S_i$ such that $P_{i,\mu}(\bu_i)$ is
non-zero; by~\cite[Lemma~3.3]{Mourrain97} we have $w \le
N_i-1$. Then, we let
$$\pi =\sum_{\mu \in S_i,\ |\mu|=w}P_{i,\mu}(\bu_i) X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
X_n^{\mu_n}$$ be the {\em symbol} of $\lambda$; by construction,
this is a non-zero polynomial. In the following paragraphs, we will
need the next easy lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:symbol0}
	Fix $i$ in $\{1,\dots,d\}$. For a generic choice of $\lambda$ in ${\rm
		hom}_\Kbar(Q_i,\Kbar)$, and of $t_1,\dots,t_n$ in $\Kbar{}^n$,
	$\pi_i(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ is non-zero.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\Omega$ be the maximum of all $|\mu|=\mu_1+\cdots+\mu_n$ for
	$\mu=(\mu_1,\dots,\mu_n)$ in $S_i$, and define 
	$$\Pi =\sum_{\mu \in S_i,\ |\mu|=\Omega}P_{i,\mu} X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
	X_n^{\mu_n} \in \Kbar[U_{i,1},\dots,U_{i,D_i},X_1,\dots,X_n];$$ this
	is by construction a non-zero polynomial.  Thus, for a generic
	choice of $\bu_i=(u_{i,1},\dots,u_{i,D_i})$, that define a linear form
	$\lambda$ in ${\rm hom}_\Kbar(Q_i,\Kbar)$ as in \cref{ell_param},
	and of $t_1,\dots,t_n$ in $\Kbar{}^n$, the value
	$\Pi(u_{i,1},\dots,u_{i,D_i},t_1,\dots,t_n)$ is non-zero. As a
	result, the symbol of such a linear form $\lambda$ is $\pi =\sum_{\mu \in
		S_i,\ |\mu|=\Omega}P_{i,\mu}(\bu_i) X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots X_n^{\mu_n},$
	and $\pi(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ is then non-zero.
\end{proof}



Finally, we say a word about global objects.  Fix a linear form $\ell:
Q \to \K$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exist unique
$\ell_1,\dots,\ell_d$, with $\ell_i$ in ${\rm hom}_\Kbar(Q_i,\Kbar)$
for all $i$, such that the extension $\ell_\Kbar: Q\otimes_\K \Kbar
\to \Kbar$ decomposes as $\ell_\Kbar = \ell_1 + \cdots + \ell_d$. We
call {\em support} of $\ell$ the subset $\mathfrak{S}$ of
$\{1,\dots,d\}$ such that $\ell_i$ is non-zero exactly for $i$ in
$\mathfrak{S}$.  As a consequence, for all $f$ in $Q$, we have
\begin{align}\label{eq:fui}
\ell(f) &= \ell_1(f) + \cdots + \ell_d(f)\nonumber\\
&=  \sum_{i \in \mathfrak{S}} \ell_i(f).
\end{align}
For $i$ in $\mathfrak{S}$, we denote by $w_i$ and $\pi_i$ respectively
the order and the symbol of $\ell_i$. For such a subset
$\mathfrak{S}$, we also write $Q_\mathfrak{S}=\prod_{i \in
	\mathfrak{S}} Q_i$ and $V_\mathfrak{S}=\cup_{i \in \mathfrak{S}}
\{\balpha_i\}$.


\subsubsection{A fundamental formula.}  The following lemma 
gives an explicit form for a generating series of the form $\sum_{\ell
	\ge 0} \ell(v t^i)T^\ell$, for a linear form $\ell:Q \to \K$. A
slightly less precise version of it is in~\cite{BoSaSc03}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:formula}
	Let $\ell$ be in ${\rm hom}_\K(Q,\K)$, with support $\mathfrak{S}$,
	and let $\{\pi_i \mid i \in \mathfrak{S}\}$ and $\{w_i \mid i \in
	\mathfrak{S}\}$ be as above.
	
	Let $t=t_1 X_1 + \cdots +t_n X_n$, for some $t_1,\dots,t_n$ in $\K$
	and let $v$ be in $\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$. Then, we have the equality
	\begin{align}\label{eq:sumgenseries}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} \ell(v t^s)/T^{s+1} =
	\sum_{i \in \mathfrak{S}} \frac{
		v(\balpha_i)\, w_i!\, \pi_{i}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
		+ (T-t(\balpha_i))A_{v,i}}
	{(T-t(\balpha_i))^{w_{i}+1}},    
	\end{align}
	for some polynomials $\{A_{v,i} \in \Kbar[T] \mid i \in \mathfrak{S}\}$ (that
	depend on the choice of $v$), with $A_{v,i}$ of degree less than $w_i$ for all $i$ in
	$\mathfrak{S}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Take $v$ and $t$ as above. Consider first
	an operator of the form $f \mapsto \frac{ \partial^{|\mu|}  f}
	{\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots \partial X_n^{\mu_n}}$, where 
	we write $|\mu|=\mu_1+\cdots+\mu_n$. Then, we have
	the following generating series identities, with coefficients in 
	$\K(X_1,\dots,X_n)$:
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} 
	\frac{ \partial^{|\mu|} ( v t^s )} {\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
		\partial X_n^{\mu_n}}
	\frac{1}{T^{s+1}} 
	&=  \sum_{s \ge 0} 
	\frac{ \partial^{|\mu|} (v t^s/T^{s+1})} {\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
		\partial X_n^{\mu_n}}\\
	&=  
	\frac{ \partial^{|\mu|} } {\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
		\partial X_n^{\mu_n}}
	\left (\sum_{s \ge 0} v t^s/T^{s+1}\right ) \\
	&= \frac{ \partial^{|\mu|} } {\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
		\partial X_n^{\mu_n}}
	\left (\frac v{T-t} \right ) \\
	&= v\, |\mu|!\, \prod_{1 \le k \le n} 
	\left (\frac{ \partial t} {\partial X_k} \right)^{\mu_k}
	\frac {1}{(T-t)^{|\mu|+1}} + \frac{P_{|\mu|}(\bX,T)}{(T-t)^{|\mu|}} + \cdots + \frac{P_{1}(\bX,T)}{(T-t)}\\
	&= v\, |\mu|!\, \prod_{1 \le k \le n} 
	t_k^{\mu_k}
	\frac {1}{(T-t)^{|\mu|+1}} + \frac{P(\bX,T)}{(T-t)^{|\mu|}},
	\end{align*}
	for some polynomials $P_1,\dots,P_{|\mu|},P$ in $\K[\bX,T]$ that
	depend on the choices of $\mu$, $v$ and $t$, with $\deg(P_i,T) < i$
	for all $i$ and thus $\deg(P,T) < |\mu|$.
	
	Take now a linear combination of such operators, such as 
	$f \mapsto \sum_{\mu \in R} c_\mu \frac{ \partial^{|\mu|}  f } {\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
		\partial X_n^{\mu_n}}$. The corresponding generating series
	becomes
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} 
	\sum_{\mu \in R} c_\mu \frac{ \partial^{|\mu|} ( v t^s )} {\partial X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
		\partial X_n^{\mu_n}}
	\frac{1}{T^{s+1}}
	&=
	v\,\sum_{\mu \in R} c_\mu
	|\mu|!\, \prod_{1 \le k \le n} 
	t_k^{\mu_k}
	\frac {1}{(T-t )^{|\mu|+1}} +\sum_{\mu \in R} \frac{P_\mu(\bX,T)}{(T-t)^{|\mu|}},
	\end{align*}
	where each $P_\mu$ has degree less than $|\mu|$ in $T$.
	Let $w$ be the maximum of all $|\mu|$ for $\mu$ in $R$. We can rewrite 
	the above as
	\begin{align*}
	v\, w! 
	\sum_{\mu \in R, |\mu|=w} c_\mu
	\, \prod_{1 \le k \le n} 
	t_k^{\mu_k}
	\frac {1}{(T-t )^{w+1}}
	+ \frac{A(\bX,T)}{(T-t )^{w}},
	\end{align*}
	for some polynomial $A$ of degre less than $w$ in $T$. If we let 
	$\pi =\sum_{\mu \in R,\ |\mu|=w} c_{\mu} X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
	X_n^{\mu_n}$, this becomes
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} 
	\sum_{\mu \in R} c_\mu \frac{ \partial^{|\mu|} ( v t^s )} { X_1^{\mu_1} \cdots
		X_n^{\mu_n}}
	\frac{1}{T^{s+1}} 
	&=
	v\, w! \,  \pi(t_1,\dots,t_n)
	\frac {1}{(T-t )^{w+1}}
	+ \frac{A(\bX,T)}{(T-t )^{w}}.
	\end{align*}
	Applying this formula to the sum in \cref{eq:fui}, we obtain the
	claim in the lemma.
\end{proof}

\noindent 
The most useful consequence of the previous lemma is the following
interpolation formula, where we fix a subset $\mathfrak{S}$ of 
$\{1,\dots,d\}$. The mapping $t:V_\mathfrak{S} \to \Kbar$
defined by $\balpha_i \mapsto t(\balpha_{i})$ plays a special role in
the formula in the lemma; this leads us to the following definitions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item We consider $\ell$ and $t$ as in \cref{lemma:formula}, such
	that $\ell$ has support $\mathfrak{S}$.
	\item $\mathfrak{T}$ is the subset of $\mathfrak{S}$ consisting of
	all indices $i$ such that 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\pi_i(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ is non-zero;
		\item $t(\balpha_{i'}) \ne t(\balpha_i)$ for $i' \ne i$ in $\mathfrak{S}$.
	\end{itemize}
	\item $\{r_1,\dots,r_c\}$ are the pairwise distinct values taken by $t$ on
	$V_\mathfrak{S}$, for some $c \le |\mathfrak{S}|$.
	\item $\mathfrak{t}$ is the set of all indices $j$ in
	$\{1,\dots,c\}$ such that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the fiber $t^{-1}(r_j) \subset V_{\mathfrak{S}}$ contains a single
		point, written $\balpha_{\sigma_j}$;
		\item the point $\balpha_{\sigma_j}$ is in $\mathfrak{T}$
		(equivalently,  $\pi_{\sigma_j}(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ is non-zero).
	\end{itemize}
	Remark that $j \mapsto \sigma_j$ induces a one-to-one correspondence
	between  $\mathfrak{t}$ and  $\mathfrak{T}$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:anyv}
	Let $\ell$, $t$ and all other notation be as above. Let further
	$M$ be the minimal polynomial of $t$ in $Q_\mathfrak{S}$. Suppose that 
	$M$ is also the minimal polynomial of the sequence $(\ell(t^s))_{s \ge 0}$,
	then there exist non-zero constants $\{c_j \mid j \in
	\mathfrak{t}\}$  such that for $v$ in
	$\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$,
	$$\Omega((\ell(v t^s))_{s\ge0},M) = c_{j} v(\balpha_{\sigma_j}) \quad \text{for all $j$ in $\mathfrak{t}$.}$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	For $j=1,\dots,c$, we write $T_j$ for the set of all indices $i$ in
	$\mathfrak{S}$ such that $t(\balpha_{i})=r_j$; the sets
	$T_1,\dots,T_c$ form a partition of $\mathfrak{S}$. When $T_j$ has
	cardinality~$1$, we thus have $T_j=\{\sigma_j\}$.
	
	Take an arbitrary $v$ in $\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ and let us
	collect terms in \cref{eq:sumgenseries} as
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} \ell(v t^s)\frac{1}{T^{s+1}} =&
	\sum_{j \in \{1,\dots,c\}}
	\sum_{i \in T_j} \frac{
		v(\balpha_{i})   w_{i}!\, \pi_{i}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
		+ (T-r_{j} )A_{v,i}}
	{(T-r_{j} )^{w_{i}+1}}\\
	=&
	\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{s}}
	\frac{
		v(\balpha_{\sigma_{j}})  w_{\sigma_j}!\, \pi_{\sigma_j}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
		+ (T-r_{j}  )A_{v,\sigma_j} }
	{(T-r_{j} )^{w_{\sigma_j}+1}}\\
	&+
	\sum_{j \in \{1,\dots,c\}-\mathfrak{s}}
	\frac{   \sum_{i \in T_j} \Big( \big[
		v(\balpha_{i})   w_{i}!\, \pi_{i}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
		 + (T-r_{j}  )A_{v,i} \big ]
		(T-r_{j} )^{y_j-(w_i+1)}\Big)}
	{(T-r_{j} )^{y_j}},
	\end{align*}
	where $y_j$ is the maximum of all $w_i$ for $i$ in $T_j$.  Remark that
	for $v=1$, our condition that $\pi_i$ is non-zero for $i$ in
	$\mathfrak{T}$ implies that in the second line, together with our
	assumption on the characteristic of $\K$, imply that all terms in the
	first sum are non-zero and in reduced form.  
	
	After simplyfing terms in the second sum, we can rewrite the
	expression above as
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} \ell(v t^s)\frac{1}{T^{s+1}} =&
	\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{t}} \frac{
		v(\balpha_{\sigma_{j}})   w_{\sigma_{j}}!\, \pi_{{\sigma_{j}}}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
		+ (T-r_{j} )A_{v,\sigma_{j}}}
	{(T-r_{j} )^{w_{\sigma_{j}}+1}}  
	+\sum_{j \in  \{1,\dots,c\}-\mathfrak{s}}
	\frac{D_{v,j}}
	{(T-r_{j})^{z_{v,j}}},
	\end{align*}
	for some positive integers $\{z_{v,j} \mid j\in
	\{1,\dots,c\}-\mathfrak{s}\}$ and polynomials $\{D_{v,j} \mid j\in
	\{1,\dots,c\}-\mathfrak{s}\}$ such that for all $j$ in $
	\{1,\dots,c\}-\mathfrak{s}$, we have $\deg(D_{v,j}) < z_{v,j}$ and
	$\gcd(D_{v,j}, (T-r_{j} ))=1$; the integers $z_{v,j}$ are uniquely
	determined by these conditions, except if $r_{j}=0$, in which case we
	set $z_{v,j}=\deg(D_{v,j})+1$. Some of the polynomials $D_{v,j}$ may
	vanish, so we let $\mathfrak{u}_v \subset \{1,\dots,c\}-\mathfrak{s}$
	be the set of all $j$ for which this is not the case. 
	We then arrive at our final form for this sum, namely
	\begin{align}\label{eq:sumgenseries_collect1}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} \ell(v t^s) \frac{1}{T^{s+1}} =&
	\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{t}} \frac{
		v(\balpha_{\sigma_{j}})   w_{\sigma_{j}}!\, \pi_{{\sigma_{j}}}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
		+ (T-r_{j}  )A_{v,\sigma_{j;}}}
	{(T-r_{j} )^{w_{\sigma_{j}}+1}}  
	+\sum_{j \in  \mathfrak{u}_v}
	\frac{D_{v,j}}
	{(T-r_{j} )^{z_{v,j}}},
	\end{align}
	where all terms in the second sum are non-zero and in reduced form
	(and similarly for the first sum, for $v=1$).
	This implies that the minimal
	polynomial of the sequence $(\ell(vt^s))_{s \ge 0}$ is 
	$$M_v=\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{t}} (T-r_{j})^{\zeta_j} \prod_{j
		\in \mathfrak{u}_v} (T-r_{j})^{z_{v,j}},$$
	for some integers $\{\zeta_j \le w_{\sigma_{j}}+1 \mid j \in \mathfrak{t}\}$; for $v=1$, 
	we actually have $\zeta_j = w_{\sigma_{j}}+1$ for all such~$j$.
	
	Now, for $v=1$, we assume that the minimal polynomial of the sequence
	$(\ell(t^s))_{s \ge 0}$ is the minimal polynomial $M$ of $t$ in
	$Q_\mathfrak{S}$.  Writing $\mathfrak{u}=\mathfrak{u}_1$ and
	$z_k=z_{1,k}$ for all $k$ in $\mathfrak{u}$, we can thus write it as
	$$M=\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{t}} (T-r_{j})^{w_{\sigma_{j}}+1} \prod_{j
		\in \mathfrak{u}} (T-r_{j})^{z_{j}}.$$ Since it is the minimal
	polynomial of $t$ in $Q_\mathfrak{S}$, it also cancels the sequence
	$(\ell(v t^s))_{s \ge 0}$ for any $v$, so that for all $v$,
	$\mathfrak{u}_v$ is contained in $\mathfrak{u}$ and $M_v$ divides $M$.
	Remark also that the integer $\delta=\deg(M)$ is given by
	$$\delta=\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{t}} (w_{\sigma_j}+1)
	+\sum_{j\in\mathfrak{u}} z_{j}.$$ 
	
	For $v$ arbitrary in $\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$, since  $M$ cancels the sequence
	$(\ell(v t^s))_{s \ge 0}$, $\Omega((\ell(v t^s))_{s \ge 0} ,M)$ in the statement of
	the lemma is indeed a polynomial of degree less than $\delta$ (this
	proves our first claim). We can then rewrite the
	sum in \cref{eq:sumgenseries_collect1} as $ \sum_{s \ge 0} \ell(v
	t^s)/T^{s+1} =\Omega((\ell(v t^s))_{s \ge 0} ,M)/M$, with
	\begin{align*}
	\Omega((\ell(v t^s))_{s \ge 0} ,M)=&\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{t}} \Big(\big[
	v(\balpha_{\sigma_{j}})  w_{\sigma_j}!\, \pi_{\sigma_j}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
	+ (T-r_j)\tilde A_{v,\sigma_j}\big]
	\prod_{\iota \in \mathfrak{t}-\{j\}}(T-r_{\iota} )^{w_{\sigma_{\iota}}+1}
	\Big)\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{u}}(T-r_j )^{z_j}
	\\
	&+
	\Big(\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{t}}(T-r_{j} )^{w_{\sigma_j}+1}\Big)
	\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{u}_v} \Big (
	(T-r_j)^{z_{j}-z_{v,j}} D_{v,j}
	\prod_{\iota \in \mathfrak{u}-\{j\}}(T-r_{\iota} )^{z_{\iota}}\Big),
	\end{align*}
	In particular, 
	for $k$ in $\mathfrak{t}$,
	the value $\Omega((\ell(v t^s))_{s \ge 0} ,M)(r_k)$ is 
	\begin{align*}
	\Omega((\ell(v t^s))_{s \ge 0} ,M)(r_k)&= v(\balpha_{\sigma_{k}}) w_{\sigma_k}!\, \pi_{\sigma_k}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
	\prod_{\iota \in \mathfrak{t}-\{k\}}(r_\iota-r_{k} )^{w_{\sigma_{\iota}}+1}
	\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{u}}(r_j-r_{k} )^{z_{k}}\\
	&= v(\balpha_{\sigma_{k}}) c_{k},
	\end{align*}
	with 
	$$c_{k}=
	w_{\sigma_k}!\, \pi_{\sigma_k}(t_1,\dots,t_n)
	\prod_{\iota \in \mathfrak{t}-\{k\}}(r_\iota-r_{k} )^{w_{\sigma_{\iota}}+1}
	\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{u}}(r_j-r_{k} )^{z_{k}}$$
	for $k$ in $\mathfrak{t}$. This is a non-zero constant, independent 
	of $v$, which finishes the proof of the lemma.
\end{proof}

As an application, the following algorithm shows how to compute a
zero-dimensional parametrization of $V_{\mathfrak{S}}$.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{$\mathsf{ParametrizationGeneric}(\ell,t)$}
	~\\
	{\bf Input:} \vspace{-0.5em}
	\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item  a linear form $\ell$ over $Q_\mathfrak{S}$

	\end{enumerate}
	\label{algo:para2}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{lemma}
	Suppose that $\ell$ is a generic element of ${\rm
		hom}_{\Kbar}(Q_\mathfrak{K},\Kbar)$ and that $t$ is a generic
	linear form. Then the output $((P,V_1,\dots,V_n),t)$ of
	$\mathsf{Parametrization}(\ell,t)$ is a zero-dimensional
	parametrization of $V_{\mathfrak{S}}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	A generic choice of $t$ separates the points of $V_{\mathfrak{S}}$,
	and we saw in \cref{lemma:symbol0} that for a generic choice of
	$\ell$, $\pi_i(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ vanishes for no $i$ in
	$\mathfrak{S}$.  As a result, $\mathfrak{T}=\mathfrak{S}$.  Besides,
	we recall that for a generic $\ell$ in ${\rm
		hom}_{\Kbar}(Q_\mathfrak{S},\Kbar)$, the minimal polynomials of
	$(\ell(t^s))_{s \ge 0}$ and of $t$ are the same
	(\cref{lemma:minpoly}).
	
	Thus, the polynomial $M$ we compute at step 1 is indeed the minimal
	polynomial of $t$, and we can apply the previous lemma, and for 
	any root $r_j$ of $P$, and $i=1,\dots,n$, we have
	$$\frac{ C_{X_i}(r_j)}{ C_1(r_j)}  = 
	\frac{\Omega((\ell(X_i t^s))_{s\ge0}, M)(r_j)}{\Omega((\ell(t^s))_{s\ge0} ,M)(r_j)}=
	\frac{c_j \alpha_{\sigma_j,i}}{c_j} = \alpha_{\sigma_j,i},$$
	so that $ C_{X_i}/ C_1 \bmod P$ is the $i$th polynomial in
	the zero-dimensional parametrization of $V$ corresponding to $t$.
\end{proof}

We demonstrate how this algorithm works through a small example. Let 
$I = \langle (X_1-1)(X_2-2),(X_1-3)(X_2-4)\rangle \subset
GF(101)[X_1,X_2]$, then
clearly $V(I) = \{ (1,4),(3,2) \}$ and $X_1$ separates the
points of $V$. We choose a random linear form 
$$\ell: f \in I \mapsto \mathbb{N},\;\ell(f) = 17 f(1,4) + 33 f(3,2)$$
Then we have
\begin{align*}
\ell(X_1^i) &= 17 \cdot 1^i + 33 \cdot 3^i\\
\ell(X_2X_1^i) &= 17 \cdot 4 \cdot 1^i + 33 \cdot 2 \cdot 3^i
\end{align*} 
We define an infinite series for each sequence
\begin{align*}
Z_1 = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \ell(X^i_1) / T^{i+1}
&= \frac{17}{T-1} + \frac{33}{T-3}
= \frac{17(T-3)+33(T-1)}{(T-1)(T-3)} \\
Z_2 = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \ell(X_2X^i_1)/T^{i+1} 
&= \frac{17\cdot 4}{T-1} + \frac{33 \cdot 2}{t-3}
= \frac{17\cdot 4 (T-3) + 33\cdot 2(T-1)}{(T-1)(T-3)}
\end{align*}
$Z_1$ and $Z_2$ have a common denominator $P = (t-1)(t-3)$,
whose roots are the coordinates of $X_1$ in $V(I)$. Now, let
\begin{align*}
R_2 
&=\frac{\Omega((\ell(X_2X^i_1))_{i\ge 0},P)}{\Omega((\ell(X^i_1))_{i\ge 0},P)} \mod P\\
&= 
\frac{17\cdot 4 (T-3) + 33\cdot 2(T-1)}{17(T-3)+33(T-1)} \mod P\\
&=\frac{4 (T-3) + 2(T-1)}{(T-3)+(T-1)} \mod P
\end{align*}
Now, $ R_2(1) = 4$ and $R_2(3) = 2$ as needed.






In what follows, $\K$ is a field.  Let $I$ be an ideal in
$\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ and $Q=\K[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I$ be the associated
residue class ring. Suppose that $V=V(I)$ has dimension zero, and
write it as $V=\{\balpha_1,\dots,\balpha_d\},$ with all $\balpha_i$'s
in $\Kbar^n$, and $\balpha_i=(\alpha_{i,1},\dots,\alpha_{i,n})$ for
all $i$.  We also let $\D$ be the dimension of $Q$, so that $d \le
\D$, and {\em we assume that ${\rm char}(\K)$ is greater than $D$}. In
this section, we recall and generalize results from the appendix
of~\cite{BoSaSc03}, with the objective of computing a zero-dimensional
parametrization of $V$.

The main novelty in our approach is to avoid generic coordinates as
much as possible. The algorithm will decompose $V$ into two parts: for
the first part, we will be able to use $X_1$ as a separating element;
the remaining points will be dealt with using a random linear
form. Throughout, we rely only the following operations: evaluations
of linear forms on successive powers of a given element in $Q$, say
$1,t,t^2,\dots$, and elementary operations on univariate polynomials.

The main algorithm is as follows. For the moment, we can only describe
its main structure; the details of the subroutines are given in the
next paragraphs.

	\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item a linear form $\ell$ over $Q$
		\item $t=t_1 X_1 + \cdots + t_n X_n$
	\end{itemize}
	{\bf Output:} \vspace{-0.5em}
	\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
		\item polynomials $(P,(V_1,\dots,V_n))$

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item let $\ell'=\mathsf{Update}(\ell,F,t)$
		\item let $(Q,(W_1,\dots,W_n),t)=\mathsf{ParametrizationGeneric}(\ell',t)$
		\item let $(F^*,(G^*_1,\dots,G^*_n),t)=\mathsf{ChangeCoordinate}(F,(G_1,\dots,G_n),t)$
		\item let  $(P,(V_1,\dots,V_n))=\mathsf{Union}(F^*,(G^*_1,\dots,G^*_n),\, Q,(W_1,\dots,W_n))$
		\item \textbf{return} $(P,(V_1,\dots,V_n),t)$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

The call to $\mathsf{ParametrizationX}_1(\ell)$ computes a
zero-dimensional parametrization of a subset $V'$ of $V$ for which
$X_1$ is a separating element, using values of the form
$(\ell(X_1^s))_{s \ge 0}$. We then modify $\ell$ (which in effect
removes from $V$ the points we just found) and apply
$\mathsf{ParametrizationGeneric}(\ell',t)$, to obtain a
zero-dimensional parametrization of $V''=V-V'$ using values of the form
$(\ell'(t^s))_{s \ge 0}$. The last two steps involve changing
coordinates in $(F,(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ (to use $t$ as a separating
variable instead), and performing the union of the two components $V'$
and $V''$.

\section{Block Sparse-FGLM algorithm}
In this section, we will show how to extend the Sparse-FGLM
to using blocking methods. Steel's method also uses the
Block Wiedemann algorithm to compute the minimal polynomial
of $\mM_i$, for which the roots provide the appropriate
values for $X_i$,
but uses the ``evaluation" method for the rest
(another Gr\"obner Basis computation with that variable
evaluated at each root of the minimal polynomial) \cite{Steel15}.
Our algorithm computes the rest of the lex
Gr\"obner basis directly.

Given:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c c}
		$I \subset \mathbb{K}$:& zero dimensional ideal
		in shape position\\
		$\mathbb{B} \subset \mathbb{K}[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I$:&
		monomial basis of $\mathbb{K}[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I$\\
		$D$: & dimension of $\mathbb{B}$\\
		$\mM_1, \dots,\mM_n$:& multiplication matrices of
		$X_1 ,\dots,X_n$ respectively\\
		$t$:& random linear combination of $X_i$'s\\
		$\mM$:& multiplication matrix of $t$
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
we compute a lex Gr\"obner basis that have the same points
in its variety as the radical of $I$ 
(note that we do not assume that $I$ is radical).
This is because we introduce another variable $t$ which,
generically, separates the points in the variety.
We also assume that the base field $\K$ has characteristic
larger than $D$. More precisely, we want to find polynomials
$(R,R_1,\dots,R_n)$ such that for all $\alpha$ that is a factor of
$R$, $\{ (R_1(\alpha),\dots,R_n(\alpha)) \} = V(I)$

The main idea is to compute the minimal polynomial
of $\mM$ by using the block Wiedemann algorithm.
This is done by applying the Matrix Berlekamp-Massey algorithm of
\cref{section:matrix_seq} on the sequence 
$S = (\mU^{\perp}\mM^i\mV)_{0 \le i < 2 \lceil \frac{D}{m} \rceil}$,
for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $U,V \in \mathbb{K}^{D \times m}$,
and taking the largest invariant factor.
We find the rest of the polynomials in the output by extracting
the scalar closed forms from the matrix closed forms. Lastly,
we denote a matrix $\mN$ with all its terms of negative exponents removed
as $ (\mN)_{T^{\ge 0}} $

			\item {\sf $R_j=N_j/N$ mod $R$}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	\label{algo:block-sparse-fglm}
\end{algorithm}

In lines 2,4, and 9.1 of the above algorithm, we use $(\mU^{\perp}\mM^i)_{i\ge 0}$, which we compute once
in line 2 and store. Computing this sequence is the bottleneck of the algorithm, but this can be
parallelized. Let $\mU \in \mathbb{K}^{D \times m}$, then we can write $\mU$ as $[u_1 u_2 \dots u_m]$ where
$u_k \in \mathbb{K}^{D \times 1}$, $1 \le k \le m$, is a vector. Now,
$$ \mU^{\perp} \mM^i = [u_1^{\perp} \dots u_m^{\perp}] \mM^i = [u_1^{\perp} \mM^i \dots u_m^{\perp} \mM^i],$$
where each product $u_k^{\perp} \mM^i$ is independent of others. Therefore, to generate the
sequence $(\mU^{\perp}\mM^i)_{i\ge0}$, we generate, in parallel, 
the sequences $(u_k^{\perp} \mM^i)_{i\ge0}$, $1 \le k \le m$, and concatenate them together as above.
Let $c$ be the sparsity of $\mM$, then generating $(u_k^{\perp} \mM^i)_{0 \le i < 2d}$ costs 
$O(d cD^2) = O(cD^3/m )$ field operations. If we are able to compute $m$ 
vector-matrix products in parallel at once, the total cost of generating $(\mU^{\perp}\mM^i)_{0 \le i < 2d}$
is $O(cD^3/m)$. We can then compute $(\mU^{\perp}\mM^i\mV)_{0 \le i < 2d}$ by a product
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mU^{\perp}\\
\mU^{\perp} \mM\\
\mU^{\perp} \mM^2\\
\vdots\\
\mU^{\perp} \mM^{2d}\\
\end{bmatrix} \mV
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mU^{\perp} \mV\\
\mU^{\perp} \mM \mV\\
\mU^{\perp} \mM^2 \mV\\
\vdots \\
\mU^{\perp} \mM^{2d} \mV\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
in cost $O(m^{\omega-2}D^2)$.

Recall, from \cref{section:matrix_seq}, that we can compute
the minimum generating polynomial matrix in $O(m^{\omega} M(D/m) \log(D/m))$.
The largest invariant factor $P$ and the quotient $a$ in lines 5 and 6 respectively by using the high-order
lifting algorithm of \cite[Algorithm~5]{Stor03}. 
By \cite[Corollary~16]{Stor03}, the cost of this is 
\todo{$O(m^{\omega} M(D/m) \log(D/m) \log(m))$}.
Now, for any $v\in\mathbb{K}^{D \times 1}$, computing $(\mU \mM^i v)_{0\le i < d}$ costs
$O(D^2)$ by using the above method.
Recall, from \cref{section:linseq}, that
we can compute $\mN_v^* = \mF^{\mU,\mV}\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} {(\mU^{\perp}\mM^iv)}/{T^{i+1}}$ by first
doing a product $\mF^{\mU,\mV}\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} {(\mU^{\perp}\mM^iv)}T^i$.
Since both $\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} {(\mU^{\perp}\mM^iv)}T^i$
have degree at most $d$, this product can be done in cost $O(m^2M(D/m))$.

Now, $\mN_v^*$ has degree less than $D/m$ and $a$ has degree at most $D$, so
computing $a \mN_v^*$ costs $O(m^2M(D/m))$. Therefore, computing $N,N_1,\dots,N_j$ costs $O(n(m^2M(D/m)))$.
Since $P,R,N,N_j$, $1\le j \le n$
have degree at most $D$, lines 6 and 9.3 costs $O^{\tilde{~}}(D)$.
Finally, assuming perfect parallelization and $m << D$, we get the cost 
$$O(cD^3/m + m^{\omega} M(D/m) \log(D/m) \log(m) + nm^2M(D/m)),$$




\subsection{Proof of Correctness}


The largest invariant factor of $T\mI - \mM$ is the minimal polynomial
of $\mM$. Therefore, the above theorem shows that if we choose the
entries of $\mU$ and $\mV$ randomly, we will have that the largest
invariant factor of $\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ is the minimal polynomial of $\mM $
with high probability.

Next, we prove that one can recover a scalar numerator through a matrix
numerator.  \todo{Vincent: the next lemma is straightforward and doesn't
  deserve a statement/proof. The inverse can be written $(\mF^{\mU,\mV})^{-1} =
  \mA\mat{D}^{-1}\mB$ where $\mA,\mB$ are (unimodular) polynomial matrices, and
$\mat{D}$ is the Smith form which is a diagonal of divisors of the largest
invariant factor $P$. So there's nothing to prove.}

\begin{lemma}\label{utilde}
	Let $\textbf{a}$ be defined as line 7 of \cref{algo:block-sparse-fglm}, 
	then $\textbf{a}$ has polynomial entries.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\mathscr{D} = \mA\mF^{\mU,\mV}\mB$ be the Smith normal form of $\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ and $s_1, \cdots s_m$ be
	invariant factors of $\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ such that 
	$s_m | s_{m-1} | \cdots | s_1$.
	Let $[b_1,\cdots,b_m]$ be the last row of $\mB$ and 
	$w = [\frac{s_1b_1}{s_m},\frac{s_1b_2}{s_{m-1}},\cdots,\frac{s_1b_{m-1}}{s_2},b_m]$ (since $s_i | s_1$), then
	\begin{align*}
	(w \mA) \mA^{-1} \mathscr{D} &=  [\frac{s_1b_1}{s_m},\frac{s_1b_2}{s_{m-1}},\cdots,\frac{s_1b_{m-1}}{s_2},b_m]
	\begin{bmatrix}
	s_m &        & \\
	& \ddots & \\
	&        & s_1
	\end{bmatrix}\\
	&= [s_1b_1, s_1b_2, \cdots, s_1b_m]\\
	&= [0,\cdots,0,s_1] \mB
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, if $a = w \mA$, we get
	$ a \mF^{\mU,\mV} = (w \mA) \mA^{-1} \mathscr{D} \mB^{-1} = 
	[0,\cdots,0,s_1]$ as needed. Since both $w$ and $\mA$ have polynomial
	entries, $a$ must also have polynomial entries.\\
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	 Let $U = [u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m]$be in $\K^{D\times m}$,
	 $\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ be the minimum generator of $(\mU^t \mM^i \mV)_{i\ge0}$,
	 and $P$ be the minimal polynomial of $\mM$. For any 
	 $v \in \K^{D}$, if\\ 
	 $\mN^* = (\mF^{\mU,\mV}\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} (\mU^t \mM^i v)/T^{i+1})_{T^{\ge0}}$ 
	 and $N = a\mN^*$,
	 then $N = \Omega((u_m^t \mM^i v)_{i\ge0},P)$.
	 \label{theorem:anyv}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $Z = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (\mU^t\mM^iv)/T^{i+1}$ and
	$\mN^{*'} = \mF^{\mU,\mV} Z$.
	Since the highest power of the entries in 
	$Z$ is $T^{-1}$, the 
	entries of the product $\mN^{*'}$ must have degree less 
	than $d = deg(\mF^{\mU,\mV})$. Furthermore, since $\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ cancels 
	the sequence $(\mU\mM^i\mV)_{i \ge 0}$, $\mN^{*'}$ is a
	polynomial matrix and does not have any terms of negative exponents.
	This means that all terms in $Z$ with degree less than $T^{-d}$ must vanish in the
	product.
	Therefore,
	$$ \mN^* = \mN^{*'}$$
	
	Now, rewrite $\mU$ as $\mU = [u_1 u_2 \cdots u_m]$, then
	$$
	\mN^* = \mF^{\mU,\mV}
	\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \mU^{\perp} \mM^i v / T^{i+1} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\sum_{i\ge 0} u_1^{\perp}\mM^iv/T^{i+1}\\
	\vdots                   \\
	\sum_{i\ge 0} u_m^{\perp}\mM^iv/T^{i+1}
	\end{bmatrix}$$
	Recall $\Omega$ from \cref{def:omega}.
	By rewriting each $\sum_{i\ge0} u_j \mM^i v$ in its closed form, we get
	$$ \mN^* = \mF^{\mU,\mV}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\Omega( (u_1^{\perp} \mM^i v)_{i\ge 0},P) / P \\
	\vdots      \\
	\Omega((u_m^{\perp} \mM^i v)_{i\ge 0},P) / P 
	\end{bmatrix}
	$$
	By \cref{randXY}, the $i^{th}$ invariant factor of
	$T\mI - \mM$ is equal to the $i^{th}$ invariant factor of $\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ 
	for generic choice of
	$\mU,\mV$. Thus, $s_1 = P$ and by \cref{utilde}
	\begin{align*}
	a \mN^* &= a \mF^{\mU,\mV}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\Omega((u_1^{\perp} \mM^i v)_{i\ge 0},P) / P \\
	\vdots      \\
	\Omega((u_m^{\perp} \mM^i v)_{i\ge 0},P) / P 
	\end{bmatrix}\\
	&= [0,\cdots,0,P]
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\Omega((u_1^{\perp} \mM^i v)_{i \ge 0},P) / P \\
	\vdots      \\
	\Omega((u_m^{\perp} \mM^i v)_{i\ge 0},P) / P 
	\end{bmatrix}\\
	&= \Omega((u_m^{\perp} \mM^i v)_{i\ge 0},P)
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, $N = \Omega(( u_m^{\perp} \mM^i v)_{i\ge 0},P)$ as needed.
\end{proof}

% l_{u_m} for linear form of u_m
Finally, we conclude by seeing what happens
when we pick specific values for $v$ and applying \cref{theorem:anyv}.
In line 4 of \cref{algo:block-sparse-fglm}, we have $v = e$, 
where $e$ is the coordinate vector for $1 \in \mathbb{B}$.
By applying \cref{theorem:anyv}, we have that
$$\mN^* = \mF^{\mU,\mV}\sum_{i\ge0}\mU^t \mM e/T^{i+1},$$  and
$$N = a\mN^* = \Omega((u_m^{\perp} \mM^i e)_{i\ge 0},P).$$
By construction,
$\mM^i e$ gives the coordinate vector of $t^i$ in $\mathbb{B}$, so
$$\sum_{i\ge 0} u_m^{\perp} \mM^i e/T^{i+1} = \sum_{i\ge0} \ell_{u_m}(t^i)/T^{i+1}$$ 
where $\ell_{u_m}$ is the linear form associated with $u_m$. Therefore, 
$$N = \Omega((u_m^{\perp} \mM^i e)_{i\ge 0},P) = \Omega( (\ell_{u_m}(t^i))_{i\ge 0},P)$$.

Similarly, in line 7.1 of \cref{algo:block-sparse-fglm}, we compute
$\mN^*_j = \mF^{\mU,\mV}\sum_{i\ge0} \mU^{\perp} \mM \mM_j e / T^{i+1}$. By \cref{theorem:anyv},
$$N_j = a \mN^*_j = \Omega((u_m^{\perp} \mM^i \mM_j e)_{i\ge 0},P) $$
Again, by construction, $\mM_j e$ is the coordinate vector for $X_j$ in 
$\mathbb{B}$ and $\mM^i \mM_j e$ is the coordinate vector for $X_jt^i$ in
$\mathbb{B}$. Therefore,
$$ N_j =  \Omega((u_m^{\perp} \mM^i \mT_j e)_{i\ge 0},P) =
 \Omega( (\ell_{u_m}(X_jt^i))_{i\ge 0},P)$$
By the correctness of \cref{algo:para2}, we have the proof
of correctness for the Block Sparse-FGLM algorithm.

\newpage
\subsection{Example}
First, we give an example in the radical case. Let
$$I = \langle -16X_1^2 - 15X_1X_2 - 14X_2^2 - 48X_1 + 26, 35X_1X_2 + 47X_1 - 46X_2 - 47 \rangle \subset GF(101)[X_1,X_2]$$
We choose $t = 2X_1 + 53 X_2$, with multiplication matrices:
\begin{align*}
\mM_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
 85&   0&  37&   0\\
 69&  85&  15&   0\\
100&  91&  19&   1\\
  1&  10&  68&   0
\end{bmatrix}\,
\mM_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
36&  1&  0&  0\\
42&  0& 85&  1\\
51&  0& 91&  0\\
95&  0& 10&  0
\end{bmatrix}\,
\mM = \begin{bmatrix}
58& 53& 74&  0\\
41& 69& 91& 53\\
75& 81& 13&  2\\
88& 20& 60&  0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
We choose $m = 2$ and choose $U,V \in GF(101)^{D\times m}$ of random
entries:
$$ \mU^{\perp} = \begin{bmatrix}
84& 38\\
29& 58\\
80& 43\\
 7& 82
\end{bmatrix}\,
\mV = \begin{bmatrix}
  6&  97\\
 83&  58\\
101&  95\\
 59&  89
\end{bmatrix}
$$
We compute the matrix sequence $S = (\mU^{\perp}\mM^i\mV)_{i\ge0}$ and its minimum generating matrix polynomial $\mG$
$$ S = (
\begin{bmatrix}
92& 75\\  
83& 51
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
57& 82\\  
23& 16
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
54& 93\\  
70& 66
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
50& 77\\
26& 76
\end{bmatrix}
)$$
$$ \mF^{\mU,\mV} =
\begin{bmatrix}
T^2 + 76T + 8&       87T + 31\\
    100T + 46& T^2 + 87T + 44
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The biggest invariant factor of $\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ is 
$$P = T^4 + 62T^3 + 85T^2 + 69T + 37 = R$$
since $P$ is square free. 
Now, we compute $\mN^*$ and $a$:
\begin{align*}
\mN^* &=[84T + 46, 38T + 65]\\
a &= [T + 55, T^2 + 76T + 8]
\end{align*}
Finally, we find the scalar numerator $N = a\mN^*$:
$$ N = 100T^3 + 26T^2 + 33T + 18$$
To get $R_1(T)$, we compute $\mN_1^*$ and $N_1=a\mN_1^*$:
\begin{align*}
\mN_1^* &= [79T + 8, 100T + 23]\\
N_1 &= 100T^3 + 26T^2 + 33T + 18
\end{align*}
Lastly,
\begin{align*}
R_1(T) &= N_1 / N \mod R \\
       &= 61T^3 + 75T^2 + 85T + 23
\end{align*}
We compute $R_2(t)= 32T^3 + 41T^2 + 94T + 22$ in the same way. 
As a sanity check,
we see that $V(I)$ has one point in $GF(101)^2$:
$(54,79)$ and $P$ has one factor in $GF(101)$: $53$. Now,
$R_1(53) = 54$ and $R_2(53) = 79$ as expected.

\section{Experimental Results}\label{section:ex}
In the following table, we give the timings in seconds for different values

On average, the algorithm performs better by a factor of 3.64 for
$m=4$ and by a factor of 5.16 for $m=8$ compared to $m=1$. We can
see that the more threads there are, the less beneficial it is
to have an additional thread. This is because
increasing $m$ has two effects: it
decreases the effectiveness of parallel computations and
also increase the time to compute the output polynomials.
From the observed speedup and the following table, 
we can conclude that the bottleneck of the
algorithm is the computation of $(\mU^{\perp} \mM^i)_{i\ge0}$ and
the latter effect is minor compared to the former, especially when
$D \ge 1000$.

We can determined the effectiveness of parallel computations by comparing
the combined CPU times as this would eliminate any benefit of parallelizing. 
If the paralleliztion was perfect, this value should be roughly equal
for all values of $m$. For example, in test ``3-vars20", we get
$4124, 4350, 6008$ seconds for $m=1,4,8$ respectively. We observed similar
patterns for other tests. Since computing $(\mU^{\perp} \mM^i)_{i\ge0}$ took
$> 99$ percent of the total time for all three values of $m$ in this test,
the increase in combined CPU times must be due to the parallelization.



\newpage
\section{Improvements for Special cases}
\subsection{Choice of the blocking size}
In general, experiments show that choosing $1 \le m \le D$ that matches
the number of cores is optimal in \cref{section:ex}. However,
when $m=1$, blocking has no effect and there is no parallelization
to be had. In particular, the minimum generating polynomial matrix
$\mF^{\mU,\mV}$ is equal to the minimum polynomial $P$ of $\mM$. Therefore,
$a = P (\mF^{\mU,\mV})^{-1} = 1$ and we can omit steps 7,8, and 9.2 in
\cref{algo:block-sparse-fglm}.

If the multiplication matrices are dense, then it is
better to compute the product $\mU \mM^i$ using a single matrix multiplication,
rather than in parallel.
When $m = D$, $\mU,\mV \in \mathbb{K}^{D \times D}$ are square matrices
and we can write $\mU\mM\mV = \mU'\mM$; therefore, we can generate sequences of the
form $(\mU\mM^i)_{i\ge0}$ rather than $(\mU\mM^iV)_{i\ge0}$. Now, $d = D/m = 1$
and we generate the sequence $ S = (\mU, \mU\mM)$. The minimum generating polynomial
matrix of $S$ is 
$$\mF^{U,M} = T - \mU\mM\mU^{-1},$$ 
and 
$$((T - \mU\mM\mU^{-1})(\mU/T + \mU\mM/T^2))_{T^{\ge 0}} = \mU. $$
For $\mM_j$, $1 \le j \le n$, we get the sequence $(\mU\mM_j,\mU\mM\mM_j)$ and
$$((T - \mU\mM\mU^{-1})(\mU\mM_j/T + \mU\mM\mM_j/T))_{T^{\ge 0}} = \mU\mM_j.$$
Thus, we get the following algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Dense Block Sparse-FGLM($\mM,\mM_1,\dots,\mM_n$)}
	{\bf Input:} \vspace{-0.5em}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mM,\mM_1,\dots,\mM_n$ defined as above
	\end{itemize}
	{\bf Output:} polynomials $(R,R_1,\dots,R_n)$
  \begin{enumerate}[{\bf 1.}]
		\item choose $\mU \in \mathbb{K}^{D\times D}$
		\item $\mF^{U,M} = T - \mU\mM\mU^{-1}$
		\item $\mN^{*} = \mU$

      \begin{enumerate}[{\bf 8.1.}]
			\item $\mN_j^* = \mU\mM_j$
			\item $N_j = a\mN_j^*e$
			\item $R_j = N_j/N$ mod $R$
		\end{enumerate}
		\item return $((R, R_1,\dots,R_n),t)$
	\end{enumerate}
	\label{algo:dense-block-sparse-fglm}
\end{algorithm}
Let $\omega$ be an exponent such that matrices of size $n$ can be multiplied
in $O(n^{\omega})$. In this case, computing $\mF^{U,M}$ costs $O(D^\omega)$
and computing $N,N_1,\dots,N_n$ costs $O(nD^2)$ since entries of $a$ has roughly degree $D$. \todo{We can solve for $a$ by
using the high-order lifting algorithm of \cite[Algorithm~5]{Stor03}. 
By \cite[Corollary~16]{Stor03}, the cost of this is $O(D^\omega \log(D))$.}
Putting everything together, we get the final cost of $O(D^\omega\log(D) + nD^2)$.

\subsection{Decomposition of linear forms.}

In this paragraph, we work over the whole $V$ (so
$\mathfrak{S}=\{1,\dots,d\}$).  Specializing our previous discussion
to the case $t=X_1$, we let $r_1,\dots,r_c$ be the pairwise distinct
values taken by $X_1$ on $V$, for some $c \le d$.  For
$j=1,\dots,c$, we write $T_j$ for the set of all indices $i$ in
$\{1,\dots,d\}$ such that $\alpha_{i,1}=r_j$; the sets $T_1,\dots,T_c$
form a partition of $\{1,\dots,d\}$. When $T_j$ has cardinality~$1$,
we denote it as $T_j=\{\sigma_j\}$, for some index $\sigma_j$ in
$\{1,\dots,d\}$, so that $\alpha_{\sigma_j,1}=r_j$.

For $i=1,\dots,d$, let us write $\nu_i$ for the degree of the minimal
polynomial of $X_1$ in $Q_i$; thus, this polynomial is
$(T-\alpha_{i,1})^{\nu_i}$. For $j$ in $\{1,\dots,c\}$, we define
$m_j$ as the maximum of all $\nu_i$, for $i$ in~$T_j$. As a result, the minimal
polynomial of $X_1$ in $\prod_{j \in T_j} Q_j$ is 
$(T-r_j)^{m_j}$, and the minimal polynomial of $X_1$ in $Q$ is
$M=\prod_{j \in \{1,\dots,c\}} (T-r_j)^{m_j}$.

Recall that a linear form $\ell: Q \to \Kbar$ can be written uniquely
as $\ell=\sum_{i\in \{1,\dots,d\}} \ell_i$, with $\ell_i:Q_i \to
\Kbar$; collecting terms, $\ell$ may also be written as $\ell=\sum_{j
	\in \{1,\dots,c\}} \lambda_j$, with $\lambda_j=\sum_{i \in T_j}
\ell_i$.  Given such an $\ell$, we first explain how to compute values
of the form $\lambda_j(1)$. We will do this for some values of $j$
only, namely those $j$ for which $m_j=1$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:valuelambda}
	Let $\ell$ be in ${\rm hom}_\K(Q,\K)$, let $M$ be the minimal
	polynomial of $X_1$ in $Q$ and let $\delta$ be its degree. Then, 
	the polynomial $\Omega((\ell(X_1^s))_{s\ge0},M)$ satisfies
	$$\Omega((\ell(X_1^s))_{s\ge0},M)(r_j) = \lambda_j(1) M'(r_j) \quad \text{for all $j$ such that $m_j=1$.}$$
	
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\mathfrak{e}$ be the set of all indices $j$ in $\{1,\dots,c\}$
	such that $m_j=1$, and let $\mathfrak{f}=\{1,\dots,c\}-\mathfrak{e}$;
	this definition allows us to split the sum as
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} \ell(X_1^s)/T^{s+1}  
	&= \sum_{j \in \{1,\dots,c\}}\sum_{i\in T_j} 
	\sum_{s \ge 0}\ell_i(X_1^s)/T^{s+1}  \\
	&=\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{e}}\sum_{i\in T_j}\sum_{s \ge 0}  \ell_i(X_1^s)/T^{s+1} +
	\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{f}}\sum_{i\in T_j}\sum_{s \ge 0}  \ell_i(X_1^s)/T^{s+1}.
	\end{align*}
	Using \cref{lemma:formula} with $t=X_1$ and $v=1$, any sum $\sum_{s \ge 0} \lambda_j(X_1^s)/T^{s+1}$ 
	in the second summand
	can be rewritten as 
	$$\frac{C_j}{(T-r_j)^{v_j}},$$
	for some integer $v_j$, and for some polynomial $C_j$ of degree less than
	$v_j$. Next, take $j$ in $\mathfrak{e}$. Since $m_j=1$, $\nu_i=1$ for all $i$ in $T_j$,
	so that
	each such $\ell_i$ takes the form 
	$$\ell_i: f \mapsto (\Lambda_{i}(f))(\balpha_i),$$ where $\Lambda_{i}$
	is a differential operator that does not involve $\partial/\partial
	X_1$. Since all terms of positive order in $\Lambda_i$ involve one of
	$\partial/\partial X_2,\dots,\partial/\partial X_n$, they cancel
	$X_1^s$ for $s\ge 0$. Thus, $\ell_i(X_1^s)$ can be rewritten 
	as $\ell_{i,1} \alpha_{i,1}^s$, for some constant $\ell_{i,1}$,
	and the generating series of these terms is 
	$$\frac {\ell_{i,1}}{T-\alpha_{i,1}}=\frac {\ell_{i,1}}{T-r_j}.$$
	Remarking  that we can write $\ell_{i,1}=\ell_i(1)$,
	altogether, the sum in question can be written
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{s \ge 0} \ell(X_1^s)/ T^{s+1}  
	&=\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{e}} 
	\frac{ \sum_{i\in T_j}  \ell_{i}(1) }{T-r_j }
	+ \sum_{j \in \mathfrak{f}} \frac{D_j}{(T-r_j )^{x_j}}\\
	&= \sum_{j \in \mathfrak{e}} 
	\frac{ \lambda_j(1) }{T-r_j }
	+ \sum_{j \in \mathfrak{f}} \frac{D_j}{(T-r_j )^{x_j}}
	\end{align*}
	for some integers $\{x_j \mid j \in b\}$ such that $\deg(D_j) < x_j$
	holds, and with $D_j$ and $T-r_j $ coprime; if $r_j=0$, we take
	$x_j=\deg(D_j)+1$. In particular, the minimal polynomial of
	$(\ell(X_1^s))_{s\ge 0}$ is $N=\prod_{j\in \mathfrak{e}}(T-r_j)
	\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{f}}(T-r_j)^{x_j}$.
	
	On the other hand, the minimal polynomial $M$ of $X_1$ can be rewritten as $M=\prod_{j\in
		\mathfrak{e}}(T-r_j) \prod_{j \in \mathfrak{f}}(T-r_j)^{m_j}$, so
	that $\delta=\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{e}} 1 + \sum_{j\in \mathfrak{f}}
	m_j$. The minimal polynomial
	of the sequence $\ell(X_1^s)$ divides $M$, so that $x_j \le m_j$ holds for all $j$ in
	$\mathfrak{f}$.
	As a result, $\Omega((\ell(X_1^s))_{s\ge0},M)$ exists and is given by
	\begin{align*}
	\Omega((\ell(X_1^s))_{s\ge0},M)=&
	\sum_{j \in \mathfrak{e}}
	\Big(
	\lambda_j(1) \prod_{\iota \in \mathfrak{e}-\{j\}}(T-r_\iota)\Big)
	\Big(\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{f}}(T-r_j)^{m_j} \Big)\\
	&+
	\sum_{j\in \mathfrak{f}}
	\Big(  (T-r_j)^{m_j-x_j} D_j
	\prod_{\iota \in \mathfrak{f}-\{j\}}(T-r_j)^{m_\iota}\Big)
	\Big(\prod_{j\in \mathfrak{e}} (T-r_j) \Big).
	\end{align*}
	This implies that $$\Omega((\ell(X_1^s))_{s\ge0},M)(r_k) =\lambda_k(1) 
	\prod_{\iota \in \mathfrak{e}-\{k\}}(r_k-r_\iota)
	\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{f}}(r_k-r_j)^{m_j} = \lambda_k(1) M'(r_k)$$ 
	holds for all $k$ in $\mathfrak{e}$.
\end{proof}

We then show how to use this result to avoid (as much as possible)
using a generic linear form $t=t_1 X_1 + \cdots + t_n X_n$, and how to
use (say) $X_1$ instead to compute a zero-dimensional parametrization
of a subset of $V$; this is motivated by the fact that the
multiplication matrix by $X_1$ is expected to be sparser than that of
$t$ (since the matrix of $t$ is a combination of those of
$X_1,\dots,X_n$), sometimes by a substantial amount. Of course, there
is no guarantee that $X_1$ is a separating element for $V$. As a
result, we will compute a decomposition of $V$ into two components
$V'$ and $V''$; $X_1$ will be a separating element for $V'$, whereas
we will use a generic linear form to describe $V''$.

More precisely, we characterize the set $V'$ mentioned above as follows: for $i$ in
$\{1,\dots,d\}$, $\balpha_i$ is in $V'$ if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
	\item for $i'$ in $\{1,\dots,d\}$, with $i'\ne i$, $\alpha_{i',1} \ne
	\alpha_{i,1}$;
	\item $Q_i$ is a reduced algebra (equivalently, $I_i$ is radical).
\end{itemize}
We denote by $\mathfrak{A}\subset \{1,\dots,d\}$ the set of
corresponding indices $i$, and we let
$\mathfrak{B}=\{1,\dots,d\}-\mathfrak{a}$, so that we have
$V'=V_{\mathfrak{A}}$ and $V''=V_{\mathfrak{B}}$.  Remark that $X_1$
is a separating element for $V'$.

Correspondingly, we define $\mathfrak{a}$ as the set of all indices
$j$ in $\{1,\dots,c\}$ such that $\sigma_j$ is in $\mathfrak{A}$. In
other words, $j$ is in $\mathfrak{a}$ if and only if $T_j$ has
cardinality $1$ and $Q_{\sigma_j}$ is reduced.  The algorithm in this
paragraph will compute a zero-dimensional parametrization of
$V_{\mathfrak{A}}$; we use the following lemma to perform this
decomposition of $V$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:acb2}
	Let $j$ be in $\{1,\dots,c\}$ such that $m_j=1$, let $\lambda$ be a
	linear form over $\prod_{i \in T_j} Q_i$ and let $t=t_2 X_2
	+ \cdots + t_n X_n$. Define constants $a,b,c$ in $\Kbar$ by
	$$a=\lambda(1),\quad b=\lambda(t),\quad c=\lambda(t^2).$$
	Then, $j$ is in $\mathfrak{a}$
	if and only if, for a generic choice of $\lambda$ and $t$, $ac=b^2$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The assumption that $m_j=1$ means that for all $i$ in $T_j$,
	$\nu_i=1$. The linear 
	form $\lambda$ can be uniquely written as a sum $\lambda=\sum_{i \in T_j}
	\ell_i$, where each $\ell_i$ is in ${\rm hom}_\Kbar(Q_i,\Kbar)$.
	The fact that all $\nu_i$ are equal to $1$ then implies that each $\ell_i$ takes the form 
	$$\ell_i: f \mapsto (\Lambda_{i}(f))(\balpha_i),$$
	where $\Lambda_{i}$ is a differential operator that does not 
	involve $\partial/\partial X_1$. Thus, as in \cref{ell_param}, we can write a general
	$\Lambda_i$ of this form as
	$$\Lambda_i: f \mapsto u_{i,1} f + \sum_{2 \le r \le n}
	P_{i,r}(u_{i,2},\dots,u_{i,D_i}) \frac{\partial}{\partial X_j} f +
	\sum_{2 \le r \le s \le n} P_{i,r,s}(u_{i,2},\dots,u_{i,D_i})
	\frac{\partial^2}{\partial X_j\partial X_k} f +
	\tilde\Lambda_i(f),$$ where all terms in $\tilde \Lambda_i$ have
	order at least $3$, $\bu_i=(u_{i,1},\dots,u_{i,D_i})$ are parameters and
	$(P_{i,r})_{2 \le r \le n}$ and $(P_{i,r,s})_{2 \le r \le s \le n}$
	are linear forms in $u_{i,2},\dots,u_{i,D_i}$.
	We obtain
	\begin{align*}
	\Lambda_i(1)   &= u_{i,1} \\
	\Lambda_i(t)   &= u_{i,1} t +\sum_{2 \le r \le n}P_{i,r}t_r \\
	\Lambda_i(t^2) &= u_{i,1} t^2  +2 t \sum_{2 \le r \le n}P_{i,r}t_r   
	+ 2\sum_{2 \le r \le s \le n} P_{i,r,s}t_rt_s,
	\end{align*}
	which gives
	\begin{align*}
	a  &= \sum_{i\in T_j}u_{i,1} \\
	b  &= \sum_{i\in T_j}u_{i,1} t(\balpha_i) +\sum_{i \in T_j, 2 \le r \le n}P_{i,r}t_r \\
	c &= \sum_{i\in T_j}u_{i,1} t(\balpha_i)^2  +2  \sum_{i \in T_j, 2 \le r \le n}t(\balpha_i) P_{i,r}t_r    
	+2 \sum_{i \in T_j, 2 \le r \le s \le n} P_{i,r,s}t_rt_s.
	\end{align*}
	Suppose first that $j$ is in $\mathfrak{a}$. Then, $T_j=\{\sigma_j\}$, so we 
	have only one term $\Lambda_{\sigma_j}$ to consider, and $Q_{\sigma_j}$ 
	is reduced, so that all coefficients $P_{\sigma_j,r}$ and
	$P_{\sigma_j,r,s}$ vanish. Thus, we are left in
	this case with
	$$
	a = u_{\sigma_j,1}, \quad
	b = u_{\sigma_j,1} t(\balpha_{\sigma_j}), \quad
	c = u_{\sigma_j,1} t(\balpha_{\sigma_j})^2,
	$$ so that we have $ac=b^2$, for {\em any} choice of $\lambda$ and
	$t$. Now, we suppose that $j$ is not in $\mathfrak{a}$, and we prove
	that for a generic choice of $\lambda$ and $t$, $ac-b^2$ is non-zero.
	The quantity $ac-b^2$ is a polynomial in the coefficients
	$(\bu_i)_{i\in T_j}$, and $(t_i)_{i \in \{2,\dots,n\}}$, and we have
	to show that it is not identically zero. We discuss two cases; in both
	of them, we prove that a suitable specialization of $ac-b^2$ is
	non-zero.
	
	Suppose first that for at least one index $\sigma$ in $T_j$,
	$Q_\sigma$ is not reduced. In this case, there exists as least one
	index $\rho$ in $\{2,\dots,n\}$ such that
	$P_{\sigma,\rho}(u_{\sigma,2},\dots,u_{\sigma,D_\sigma})$ is not
	identically zero \todo{explain better}. Let us set all $\bu_{\sigma'}$
	to $0$, for $\sigma'$ in $T_j-\{\sigma\}$, as well as $u_{\sigma,1}$,
	and all $t_r$ for $r\ne \rho$. Then, under this specialization,
	$ac-b^2$ becomes
	$-(P_{\sigma,\rho}(u_{\sigma,2},\dots,u_{\sigma,D_\sigma})t_\rho)^2$,
	which is non-zero, so that $ac-b^2$ itself must be non-zero.
	
	Else, since $j$ is not in $\mathfrak{a}$, we can assume that $T_j$
	has cardinality at least $2$, with $Q_\sigma$ reduced for all $\sigma$
	in $T_j$ (so that $P_{\sigma,r}$ and $P_{\sigma,r,s}$ vanish for 
	all such $\sigma$ and all $r,s$). Suppose that $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are two indices in
	$T_j$; we set all indices $u_{\sigma'',1}$ to zero, for $\sigma''$
	in $T_j-\{\sigma,\sigma'\}$. We are left with
	$$
	a=u_{\sigma,1}+u_{\sigma',1},\quad
	b=u_{\sigma,1}t(\balpha_{\sigma})+u_{\sigma',1}t(\balpha_{\sigma'}),\quad
	c=u_{\sigma,1}t(\balpha_{\sigma})^2+u_{\sigma',1}t(\balpha_{\sigma'})^2.
	$$
	Then, $ac-b^2$ is equal to $2u_{\sigma,1}u_{\sigma',1}(t(\balpha_{\sigma})-t(\balpha_{\sigma'}))^2$,
	which is non-zero, since $\balpha_\sigma \ne \balpha_{\sigma'}$.
\end{proof}

The previous lemmas allow us to write Algorithm
$\mathsf{ParametrizationX}_1$. After computing $M$, we determine its
factor $P=\prod_{j \in \{1,\dots,c\}, m_j=1} (T-r_j)$. We split this
polynomial further using the previous results in order to find
$\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{a}} (T-r_j)$, and we conclude using the same
kind of calculations as in $\mathsf{ParametrizationGeneric}$.

\begin{lemma}
	Suppose that $\ell$ is a generic element of ${\rm
		hom}_{\Kbar}(Q,\Kbar)$ and that $t$ is a generic linear form. Then
	the output $((P,V_1,\dots,V_n),X_1)$ of
	$\mathsf{ParametrizationX}_1(\ell,t)$ is a zero-dimensional
	parametrization of $V_{\mathfrak{A}}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\cref{lemma:minpoly} shows that for a generic choice of $\ell$,
	$M$ is the minimal polynomial of $X_1$, so that we indeed have
	$P=\prod_{j \in \{1,\dots,c\}, m_j=1} (T-r_j)$. Let then $r_j$ be
	one of these roots; by \cref{lemma:valuelambda}, for $i=0,1,2$
	we have $ A_i(r_j) = M'(r_j) (t^i \cdot \lambda_j)(1)$, where
	$\lambda_j =\sum_{i \in T_j} \ell_i$, and the $\ell_i$'s are the
	components of $\ell$. 
	
	As a result, the value of $ A_0  A_2 -  A_1^2$ at
	$r_j$ is (up to the non-zero factor $M'(r_j)^2$) equal to the
	quantity $ac-b^2$ defined in \cref{lemma:acb2}, so for a
	generic choice of $\ell$ and $t$, it vanishes if and only if $j$ is
	in $\mathfrak{a}$. Thus, after Step~\ref{step:updateP}, 
	$P$ is equal to $\prod_{j \in \mathfrak{a}} (T-r_j)$.
	
	The last step is to compute the zero-dimensional parametrization of
	$V_{\mathfrak{A}}$. This is done using again
	\cref{lemma:valuelambda}. Indeed, for $j$ in $\mathfrak{a}$, 
	$T_j$ is simply equal to $\{\sigma_j\}$, so that we have, for $i=2,\dots,n$,
	$$ A_1(r_j)=M'(r_j) \lambda_j(1) \quad\text{and}\quad 
	A_{X_i}(r_j) = M'(r_j) (X_i \cdot \lambda_j)(1) = M'(r_j) \lambda_j(X_i).$$ Now, since $j$
	is in $\mathfrak{a}$, $Q_{\sigma_j}$ is reduced, so that there
	exists a constant $\lambda_{j,1}$ such that for all $f$ in
	$\Kbar[X_1,\dots,X_n]$, $\lambda_j(f)$ takes the form $\lambda_{j,1}
	f(\balpha_{\sigma_j})$. This shows that, as claimed,
	$$\frac{ A_{X_j}(r_j)}{ A_1 (r_j)} = 
	\frac {\Omega((\ell(X_j X_1^s)_{s\ge0},M)(r_j)}{\Omega((\ell(t X_1^s))_{s\ge0},M)(r_j)}=
	\frac
	{M'(r_j) \lambda_{j,1} \alpha_{j,i}}{M'(r_j) \lambda_{j,1}} = \alpha_{j,i}.$$
	For $i=1$, since we use $X_1$ as a separating variable for $V_{\mathfrak{A}}$, 
	we simply add the polynomial $T$ to our list.
