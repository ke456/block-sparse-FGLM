if need for faster polmatmul for small degrees,
quasi-finished attempts were committed on Nov 11 (some in tests_polmatmul, others in block-sparse-fglm)
there seemed to be some issues when integrating into pm-basis (or maybe only in xgcd)

Recorded threshold for p==9001:
for m=1, take naive1 until d=600, then FFT
for m=2, take naive1 until d=256, then FFT
for m=4, take naive1 until d=128, then FFT
for m=8, take naive2 until d=100, then FFT
for m=16, take naive2 until d=110, then FFT
for m=32, take naive2 until d=90, then FFT
