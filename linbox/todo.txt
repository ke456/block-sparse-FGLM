-- mbasis: do not permute rows so that output = ordered weak Popov
-- Smith form: with modified (ordered weak Popov) mbasis, should not be problems with row order
-- tune pmbasis threshold
-- in Linbox, the mul / midproduct of polynomial matrices does not accept const... this is unfortunate since it is only touching the matrices entries, isn't it?
