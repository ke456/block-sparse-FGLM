-- tune pmbasis threshold
-- in Linbox, the mul / midproduct of polynomial matrices does not accept const... this is unfortunate since it is only touching the matrices entries, isn't it?

-- implement dense "multi-Krylov" version
-- can we obtain the same output via the dense version?
-- see about the proof of Lemma 3 in formula-proof
-- check the output of Smith form
