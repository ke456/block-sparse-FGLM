\textbf{Abstract:}

In the last decades, a lot of progress has been made on the design and the
implementation of efficient algorithms related to zero-dimensional ideals,
including for solving polynomial systems, i.e. determining the finite set of
roots common to a given collection of multivariate polynomials.  During this
process, it has turned out that these algorithms heavily rely on routines from
linear algebra.  This session focuses on the study of algorithms specifically
tailored for the particular linear algebra problems encountered in this kind of
computations.

More precisely, polynomial system solving often involves computing a first
Gr\"obner basis, typically with the F5 algorithm, and then using for example
the FGLM algorithm to obtain a representation of the sought roots.  In the
first step, one has to deal with matrices of large dimension which are sparse
and exhibit a noticeable structure.  The second step corresponds to finding the
nullspace of matrix with a structure which may be called multi-Krylov: the matrix
is formed by a given vector and its images by the successive powers of the
so-called multiplication matrices.

It was also observed recently that, by exploiting the sparsity of these
multiplication matrices, one can reduce the problem to the computation of
generators for a multi-dimensional linearly recurrent sequence.  This revived
interest into this problem, with the goal of designing algorithms which
outperform the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm, well-known for its
applications to the decoding of algebraic geometry codes.  Some approaches have
already been described, involving computations with matrices that have a
multi-layered block-Hankel structure.  This was noticed to have direct links
with the decomposition of symmetric tensors.

This session aims at gathering the main actors behind these recent
developments, and naturally all researchers interested in future developments
on this topic.
